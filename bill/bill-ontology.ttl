#######  Classes #####

pbill:PublicBill rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Public Bill"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A proposal for a new law or a proposal to significantly change an existing law affecting the population as a whole. A Public Bill is either a Government Bill or a Private Members' Bill."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/bill/> .

pbill:DraftBill rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Draft Bill"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A Government Bill issued first in a draft form to allow them to be looked at in detail before they are introduced to Parliament. They are usually examined either by a Commons or Lords select committee or by a specially created joint committee of both Houses of Parliament. This process is known as 'pre-legislative scrutiny'."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/bill/> .
	
pbill:ActOfParliament rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Act of Parliament"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "An Act of Parliament creates, amends or repeals legislation. An Act is a Bill having been passed by Parliament and been given Royal Assent. Acts of Parliament which are in force comprise statute law also known as the statute book."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/bill/> .

pbill:CarryOver rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Carry over"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The act of carrying a bill over from one session to the following session. A bill being carried over results in the creation of a new bill in the new session, the text of the new bill being the text of the original bill as amended in the first session. Public Bills which have not been passed by the end of the session in which they were first introduced will otherwise fall. A bill being before the House of Commons, it is necessary for that House to pass a carry over motion in order for the bill to be carried over into the following session. There is a similar but less formal process in the House of Lords. Private Members' Bills cannot be carried over."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/bill/> .

pbill:ParliamentActProcedureInvoked rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Parliament Act procedure invoked"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 limit the power of the House of Lords in relation to the House of Commons. They replaced the Lords' right to veto Commons Bills with a right only to delay them and put into law the Commons' exclusive powers to pass Bills on public tax and spending. In circumstances where a bill is passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords in the same session, it is possible for the Government to introduce a similar bill in the following session. If the House of Commons chooses to invoke the Parliament Act, the House of Lords has one month to agree to the bill, otherwise the Commons may pass the bill unilaterally. The similarity of a bill being introduced in a following session is not made explicit until the Speaker certifies the bill as being subject to the Parliament Act."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/bill/> .
	
pbill:Session rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Session"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A period during which Parliament is able to conduct business on days of its choosing. A session is within a Parliament period. The first session of a Parliament begins on the same day as the Parliament period and ends on a day named in a subsequent prorogation proclamation. Subsequent sessions within the Parliament period begin and end on dates named in subsequent prorogation proclamations. The final session of a Parliament ends either with prorogation followed by dissolution or with dissolution. Session periods are the same for both Houses."@en ;

pbill:DepartmentalSponsorship rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Departmental sponsorship"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The sponsorship of a bill by a government organisation. Should the machinery of Government change during the passage of a Public Bill, it is possible for the sponsorship of that bill to pass to a different government organisation."@en ;
