# RMI competency questions
 

## Compliance questions

How often do members report interests late

Are there interests a member has declared but not reported to the RMFI (or vice versa)

Are there any directorships or shareholdings reported to Companies House that members haven’t reported to the RMFI
 
## Outside employment

How many / which members have outside employment

How much has a member earned from outside employment in a calendar year / parliament / time in parliament

[oD]: We’d like to add there is no uniform way for declaring income (eg £ per hour, per annum, gross/net etc). So the additional question we'd need to pose to address this is: "Which MPs earn the most from outside interests per annum?" 

Thought would have to be given as to how one would make the data more compatible.

How much time has a member spent on outside jobs in a calendar year / parliament / time in parliament

How much has a member received in benefits in a calendar year / parliament / time in parliament

How much has a member received in donations in a calendar year / parliament / time in parliament

How many members still employ their spouse, and in what role

[oD] We’d like to add these questions:

For companies that pay MPs as employees, directors or consultants, who are their private clients?

For companies that pay MPs as employees, directors or consultants, is the company currently listed on the Register of Consultant Lobbyists?

What category of business does each of the companies listed in the RMFI operate in? (SG: SIC code presumably)

What is the UK company number of each of the companies listed in the RMFI? For companies listed in the RMFI that are not registered in the UK, what jurisdiction are they registered in?

Linkage of members to organisations e.g. as shareholders, directors, providing services to clients, unpaid roles etc.

Which members have a connection to organization x

Which members have a connection to an organization with SIC code x

Which members have a connection to a topic / theme x e.g. energy, transport, defence etc.

Which members have a connection with an oligarch/corrupt individual/regime x

How many members have unpaid outside roles

## Linkage of members to property

Which members own a property in a particular geographical area i.e. country/region/county/metropolitan area/constituency/city/town [let us know if you have any views on which geographical area you’d prefer if this was limited to only one level e.g. constituency, city/town etc.]

Which members own property and earn income in rent that meet rule thresholds

## Overseas visits

Where are the most popular destinations e.g. by country for overseas visits

What dates (from and to) did members fly overseas

Who has paid the most for overseas visits

How many sponsors of overseas visitors are foreign governments
[oD] We’d like to add…

Which overseas visits were related to the work of APPGs / Which members have undertaken foreign trips as part of APPG delegations? 

Which MPs have undertaken the most overseas visits (it could be broken down by calendar year or parliamentary session etc.)

Which MPs have undertaken the highest valued overseas visits (again, could be broken down by calendar year or parliamentary session etc.)

## Oral / written question interests

Which members have declared an interest on a written question & for what interest

Which members have declared an interest on a tabled oral question & for what interest

Which members have declared an interest before an oral contribution & for what interest

What interests has a member declared

What members have declared an interest in subject x

## Other requests

### The Times

As you point out, searching by company would be very helpful. There also needs to a normalisation of names, and for it to be made clear what entity actually provided the benefit, and any relevant controlling entity. For example, I have seen cases where a company’s acronym has been provided instead of its full name, which has raised concerns. In other cases, the description provided just doesn't tell you anything about the company concerned.

Requiring a company or charity unique entity number in disclosure, and linking out to any relevant PSc information on Companies House, could solve that issue.

Whether a member owns an exempted property. While members are not required to declare details of a property they own in which they are normally resident, it would be helpful to know if they have used this exemption.

Making them list the actual names of the companies would be great. Eddie Lister used an acronym of the property company Delancey in some of the disclosures, which is obviously very cheeky. 

On property, I fear they might push back for privacy reasons but yes, exempted properties, properties by area, rental income. It needs to be much better than it is now!

oD

What steps are taken by parliamentary authorities to ensure that the RMFI is accurate when it is published?

What consideration has parliament given to developing and promoting a national open data standard that could be used to publish registers of information data?

[The declared.info project was a project funded by Nesta and ran in partnership with openDemocracy and Open Data Services coop. It was an experiment in trying to come up with an open data standard that all Registers of Interest should be published in. 

One would need parliament to accept they should be publishing Registers of Interest as open data. Then the question is what format / structure etc this should be in - so that all public bodies can publish to the same standard. 

We began the process of trying to model what an open data standard for Registers of Interest might look like here: https://oroi-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

We built a very rudimentary website to try to demonstrate that it might be useful if you could search across both historic records and different organisations. Boris Johnson is a good example as he has interests declared at the GLA and in the Houses of Commons. The website is at declared.info  

So if there is any opportunity to underline the transparency benefits of having all public bodies publish their registers in a consistent and machine readable format then that would be huge - as it would allow third party services to search them, aggregate them and join registers from across organisations. Our ambition was to build an 'alerts' service on top of this data, so people could 'subscribe' to alerts for particular people, or companies, or organisations. There's an opportunity for Parliament to invest in the work we've already done.]
