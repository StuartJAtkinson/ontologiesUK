# Category 10: Non-financial interests

97. Certain non-financial interests may reasonably be thought to affect the way members of the House of Lords discharge their public duties and must therefore be registered in this category. The following non-financial interests are always relevant and therefore must be registered:

	(a) unremunerated directorships or other regular employment;
	
	(b) membership of public bodies such as hospital trusts, the governing bodies of universities, colleges or schools, local authorities and other spheres of government;

	(c) trusteeships of museums, galleries or similar bodies;
	
	(d) acting as an office-holder or trustee in pressure groups or trade unions; and

	(e) acting as an office-holder or trustee in voluntary or not-for-profit organisations.

98. When registering a non-financial interest in an organisation in this category, members should give a broad indication of the organisation or bodyâ€™s business or activity where this is not self-evident from its name.

99. Other non-financial interests are not registrable or (unless the member thinks it appropriate) declarable. Such interests include: other trusteeships, for example of private estates; unpaid ordinary membership of voluntary organisations or pressure groups; membership of churches or other religious bodies or organisations. The Registrar is available to advise members in cases of uncertainty.

100. The following posts should not be registered: honorary fellowships in colleges and universities; other honorary posts; offices in political parties; patrons; ex officio positions in voluntary organisations (for instance, those held by the Lords Spiritual). There may however be occasions on which such interests should be declared.
