# Category 2: Donations and other support for activities as a Member of Parliament


## 16.This category has two parts:

### Category 2(a): support received by a local party organisation or indirectly via a central party organisation (Defined as a registered political party or an accounting unit of such a party.). A Member must register under this sub-category support received by his or her constituency party organisation or which he or she receives via a central party organisation if there was a clear link between the donation and him or her; for example, if it was given to a such an organisation with a wish that it be allocated to him or her, to his or her fighting fund or to a front bench office which he or she held; if it was assigned to him or her in circumstances where he or she was aware, or could reasonably be expected to be aware, of the identity of the donor; or if he or she had invited or encouraged the donation;

### Category 2(b): any other support received by a Member. This includes support received indirectly, for example via a political club (A political club is not a registered political party or an accounting unit of such a party. It is likely to be a Members’ association under PPERA, defined as an organisation separate from, but which may be affiliated to, registered parties, but whose members come mainly from one party.). Before accepting any donations registrable under this category, Members must check that they are from a permissible donor. Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, Members must not accept impermissible donations and must notify the Electoral Commission within 30 days of receipt.22

They should register it if it exceeds the relevant financial threshold for donations. Where funds are raised for more than one Member, each should register as if he or she was the sole beneficiary.)
