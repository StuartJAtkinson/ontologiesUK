# Category 3: Gifts, benefits and hospitality from UK sources

## 26.Members are required to provide the following information:

### a)The name and address of the donor; (Private addresses will not be published.)

assume this covers donations from an individual? 

agent not group?

flag needed for private address?

### b)The amount of the donation, or its nature and value if it is a donation in kind;

nature?

is nature a controlled list?

### c)The dates of receipt (Subscriptions, memberships and staff secondments are generally regarded as received on their start dates.) and acceptance;

### d)The status of the donor (whether an individual, building society, friendly society, LLP, registered party (other than the Member’s own party), trade union, unincorporated association or company, in which case the company registration number is required);

are these examples or full list? examples

same set as in category 2?

### e)If the donor is a trust, the name and address of the person who created the trust; if created after 27 July 1999, the names and addresses of all others who have transferred property to the trust, or, if created before 27 July 1999, the date it was created;

## Benefits given to other people or organisations

### 27.A Member must register under this category any benefit given to any third party, whether or not this accompanied a benefit for him or her, if the Member is aware, or could reasonably be expected to be aware, of the benefit and that it was given because of his or her membership of the House or parliamentary or political activities.

do we capture the 3rd party?

## Benefits received during a parliamentary attachment

### 28.Members must register under this category any incidental benefit, such as gifts, hospitality, or travel, received from a UK source in the course of a fellowship or secondment such those arranged through the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, the Police Service Parliamentary Scheme or the Industry and Parliament Trust.

do we capture attachment?

## Benefits received as a member of an All-Party Parliamentary Group

### 29.Groups themselves must register any benefit which exceeds the relevant threshold set out in the Guide to the Rules for All-Party Parliamentary Groups (over £1,500 in 2015–16), either as a single donation or as multiple donations of over £500). Each Member benefiting should also include in their Register entry details of any benefit to them from a UK source which exceeds the threshold for the Members’ Register. If the ultimate donor is identifiable, Members should give their details, as well as naming the Group.

group here is appg?

do we model out appgs?

## Legal funds

### 30.Members should normally register under this category contributions to legal funds. This would apply if, for example, the legal action arose out of activity as a Member of Parliament but the donation was not specifically in support of the Member’s activities as a Member of Parliament.

is this just clarification of what to register or do we need to capture legal funds in model?
