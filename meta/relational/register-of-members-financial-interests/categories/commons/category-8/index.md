# Category 8: Miscellaneous

## Requirements for registration

### 55.Under this category Members must register:

#### a)Any relevant financial interest or material benefit which does not clearly fall into one of the other categories, including any shareholding which falls below the relevant threshold, or any other financial asset, including an asset held in trust, if the Member nevertheless considers that it meets the test of relevance; in other words, that it might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions or words as a Member; and

#### b)Any other interest, if the Member considers that it might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions or words as a Member in the same way as a financial interest. This might include an unpaid employment or directorship, or directorship of a company not currently trading, non-practising membership of a profession, or a fund established to defray legal costs arising out of the Memberâ€™s work, but from which no benefit has yet been received.

### 56.Members are required to provide the following information:

### a)A description of the interest and, where relevant, the name of the donor;

no address?

### b)Any other relevant information. It is not necessary to provide a value for financial interests in this category;

### c)The date when the interest arose or became registrable.
