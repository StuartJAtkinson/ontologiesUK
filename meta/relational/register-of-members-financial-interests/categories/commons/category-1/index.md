# Category 1: Employment and earnings

## 9.Members are required to provide the following information:

### a)Whether the Member is a director of the organisation;

Which organisation? The payee? The client? Both? Either?

Director when? At time contract entered into? At time of payment?

### b)The name and address of the payer (Unless this would be contrary to any legal or established professional duty of privacy or confidentiality) and a brief description of their business (if not self evident);

What is self evident?

Could this description vary across Members depending on work undertaken?

What if it is contrary to legal / privacy? Is this declared?

### c)The name and address of any client to whom the Member has personally provided services, (Unless this would be contrary to any legal or established professional duty of privacy or confidentiality.) if different from the payer, and a brief description of their business (if not self evident);

What is self evident?

Could this description vary across Members depending on work undertaken?

What if it is contrary to legal / privacy?

### d)The size of the payment received, and the nature and value of any taxable benefits and any payments in kind. (Earnings should be given gross, i.e. before tax or other deductions, wherever possible. Fees should be given before the addition of VAT.);

Presumably an amount, a currency and payment dates or frequency?

How do we capture the value of taxable benefits / payments in kind?

### e)The nature of the work involved, and the number of hoursâ€™ work to which each payment relates;

Can nature of work change per payment?

### f)The date when the payment was received (or, if not yet received, the date when the work was completed); and

Two different date fields?

### g)Confirmation that the Member has not engaged in paid advocacy. (As described in paragraph 1 of chapter 3 of this Guide.)

On the 'contract'?

## Members who ceased to hold Ministerial office within the previous two years

### 10.Such Members should state, additionally, whether they sought the advice of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments in respect of this employment.

Boolean to capture was minister in previous 2 years?

Another boolean for advice sought?

## Payments made to other people or organisations

### 11.A Member who receives payment for his or her work and then donates it to another person, or to a charitable or community organisation, must make their registration in the usual way but may note the donation in their Register entry.

May?

Do they need to state who to?

If so, how?

### 12.A Member who does not receive payment for his or her work in a recognisable form or at all, because it is made to another person or organisation, should nevertheless register the payment within 28 days of its receipt by that other person or organisation. This applies only to payments which, if made direct to the Member, would have required registration under this category.

Do they need to state the person who received the payment?

If so, how?

## Contractual agreements for twelve months or more

### 13.A Member who has a contractual agreement for twelve months or more and receives regular payments may choose, instead of registering each payment as it is received, to register such payments in advance, provided that he or she afterwards registers within 28 days any variation to the information already provided. The initial information to be provided is as set out in paragraph 9 above, except that instead of the information required under subparagraphs (d) and (f), the Member should provide:

#### h)The agreed start, and (if any) end dates for the contract;

#### i)The agreed payments, including any taxable benefits and payments in kind;

#### j)The dates agreed for those payments.
