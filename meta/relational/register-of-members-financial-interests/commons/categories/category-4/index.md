## Visits by others

### 37.Members should register in this category any visit outside the UK which is undertaken by someone else, whether accompanying the Member or not. Registration is required if the Member is aware, or could reasonably be expected to be aware, that part or all of the visit was paid for by another person or organisation because of that Member’s membership of the House or parliamentary or political activities. (Subject to the relevant thresholds, Members’ staff who hold parliamentary passes as secretaries or research assistants should also register their visits in the Register of Interests of Members’ Secretaries and Research Assistants.)
