A target information architecture.

A work in progress, target sitemap for the House of Commons Library, the House of Lords Library and Post:

* [Sitemap](sitemap.pdf)

Combining site structure, user journeys and URL patterns. Intended to:

* Maximise routes into content for both users and search bots.

* Maximise opportunities for collaboration between sections and publishers.

* Respect ownership, authorship and branding.

* Not restrict output to a reflection of current organisation structures.

## Models

* [Publisher model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/publisher/publisher-ontology.html)

* [Document model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/document/document-ontology.html)

* [Contribution model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/contribution/contribution-ontology.html)

Interface classes stitching these models together to follow.
