# 2024 - Week 20

## Frequently asked questions

Let's kick off by addressing a question that's been on the tip of many a tongue. We are frequently asked, "Are your librarians all called Librarian?". Yes. It is a condition of employment, continuing a tradition that's been in place since the Normans invaded and messed up a perfectly good country. We hope that clears that up.

## Outreach / engagement

It's been a busy week in terms of outreach and engagement. At least internally speaking, trips out of the office being sadly lacking these days. Not a hint exactly. We're not ones for whining.

On Wednesday, [Librarian Anya](https://bsky.app/profile/anyaso.bsky.social) gave a talk to House of Commons Library management on what Parliamentary Search is, why Parliamentary Search is, and how Parliamentary Search will be changing. A talk first cobbled together by Anya and [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social) late last year in [East London's premiere poitín bar](https://www.thesuntavern.co.uk/poitin-bar-bethnal-green/). We're told the talk went rather well. Unlike, perhaps, the trip to the poitín bar. Applause Anya.

Thursday was busier still, kicking off with a talk by Librarians [Anna](https://x.com/anna_buck), Emily and Susannah and Data Scientist Louie, filling in the background on our [psephology explorations](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/) to the whole of the House of Commons Library. Susannah explained how we'd come to build the website, Anna talked through the wrangling of the [spreadsheets](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/tree/main/db/data) that sits behind it, Emily covered some of the difficulties in mixing and matching datasets - particularly when they contain names - and Louie told us all why it's a bloody good thing. Another talk that seemed to go rather well. If you've got [Graeme](https://x.com/woodstockjag) and [John](https://bsky.app/profile/johncurtis.bsky.social) onboard, you can be pretty sure you've won over your audience. More applause Anna, Emily, Susannah and Louie. Applause [everyone](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/humans.txt).

It'd be remiss of us not to note that we stand upon the shoulders of giants. If the Library had not been collecting and verifying this data for the last few decades, no website would have been possible. And the country would have had to rely on the [BBC's neglected efforts](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/) instead. Where, when we say neglected, we clearly mean broken.

Sticking with spreadsheets, Thursday also saw Librarians Jayne and [Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social), together with computational midshipman Michael, give a talk, this time to the (Commons) Library & Information Professional Community. Or LIPC, as it's more memorably called. This one was on how to make a good spreadsheet. Or more accurately, how not to make a bad one. Don't use colours to add meaning, they said. Don't have two tables on the same sheet, they added. Don't ever hide columns, they demanded. Again, it seemed to go quite well. Yet more applause, Jayne, Phil and Michael.

## There is no such thing as Business As Usual

Our dear reader knows us as mild-mannered types. Rarely do we go off on a rant. This week, though, we make a small exception. Please forgive us.

We would like it be known that, in our view, *there is no such thing as Business As Usual*. Also, *no one should ever say Business As Usual*. At least not in our earshot. Anyone found so much as muttering Business As Usual in a meeting will find us sitting in stony silence, microphones muted and cameras off. Not you Michael, your camera's been busted for months.

We say this for three reasons:

* Organisations change - all organisations, our employer being no exception.

* Technology changes - adaptation happens, exaptation happens.

* Expectations change - our dear user wants better and faster and they are not wrong.

The idea that things can 'transition to Business As Usual' implies some belief in a definition of done. Now, if we were in the business of making books or magazines or even Telly programmes, done could indeed be defined. But we are not in those businesses. Mostly we make and manage websites, the websites being made out of software, software [aging like fish](https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/04/05/why-applications-are-like-fish-and-data-is-like-wine/). Websites just don't get 'done'.

So then, a couple of recent examples of unplanned events, the first being pertinent to organisational change. If you've been paying attention to weeknotes, you'll be well aware of the recent [procedural innovation whereby non-Ministers can now make written corrections](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmproced/521/report.html#heading-4). You'll also be aware that [our Jianhan](https://x.com/jianhanzhu) needed to [stop work on Search in order to clear out the pipes necessary for allowing non-Ministerial written corrections to flow into our search services](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2024/18/#stand-down--panic-over). All concerned will be most pleased to learn that Jianhan has now put the finishing touches to that work and we now have that rarest of all things: a [completely empty Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Bw4Hg04L/written-corrections). Wow.

The last card to be completed was the removal of the now defunct Ministerial correction category from the indexing application. Before he got round to that, Librarian Anya jumped in, pointing out there were a whole host of content types in the indexing application that have never been used and never will be used. "Hang on," said Anya, "can't we kill all the birds and have rid of all the stuff we never click and will never click?" "Sure," replied Jianhan. Which is why our indexing application is now [stripped of a whole host of cruft](https://trello.com/c/k8yKGaBB/56-make-a-list-of-things-we-never-wanted-to-see-in-indexing) that's been there for around 10 years and never served any useful purpose. Good call, Anya. Top work, Jianhan.

Job done then? Probably not. Some other procedural innovation will undoubtedly come along in the not too distant future, planned work will be put to one side and our Jianhan will once again find himself with head buried in plumbing.

As a second example, Microsoft got in touch to tell us that [STV1 was due to be deprecated at some point in August, to be replaced by STV2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/breaking-changes/stv1-platform-retirement-august-2024). Some googling proving necessary there. This is something of a pain because everything that runs through [api.parliament.uk](https://api.parliament.uk/) - from [SPARQL endpoint](https://api.parliament.uk/sparql) to our beloved egg time - runs through STV1. Once more, plans will need to be put on hold whilst poor Jianhan battles with the migration. A new Trello board popping into existence to deal with the matter. One in, one out as they say.

One would hope we have made our point. We are closer to the heat death of the universe than we are to the moment when any software anywhere can be considered *done* and packaged up to be handed over to *Business As Usual*. Even the best laid plans fall by the wayside when punched in the face by reality changing.

## New, old search

It's been a big week in the world of [new, old search](https://search-prototype.herokuapp.com/search-prototype). For the past few months - it feels like years - we've been attempting to migrate from [Solr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr) 3.5 to Solr 9, skipping five major versions on route. The data migration went well, but - unsurprisingly - the new Solr index didn't behave in quite the same way as the old Solr index. Which meant both our internal and external search services didn't behave as anyone expected. Our Jianhan made some tweaks, [Librarian Ned tested](https://trello.com/c/66PawYHL/192-testing-punctuation-adapted-solr-in-search), Jianhan made more tweaks, Ned tested again. Rinse and indeed repeat.

Finally, late this week, Ned announced he was happy. Differences remain, but nothing is different-worse and a few things are different-better. Phew. Boss 'brarian Anya met with Ned and a start was made on documenting differences. As the clock struck 11 on Friday morning, we finally moved the [<abbr title="Indexing and Data Management Section">IDMS</abbr> say they're happy with the Solr upgrade card](https://trello.com/c/V194g290/125-idms-say-happy-with-solr-upgrade) from to do to done. Marvellous work all round.

It only remains to tick a couple of process boxes and a couple more configuration boxes and we should be able to go live with the Solr upgrade in the not too distant.

Still on the subject of testing, [Young Robert](https://bsky.app/profile/robertbrook.bsky.social) and Michael have now handed over their [Cucumber / RSpec efforts](https://github.com/ukparliament/solr-specs) into the more than capable hands of Ned. Next time we need to upgrade Solr - and we will, we most definitely will - we'll have a test suite and won't be starting from scratch. You'd also hope that next time around, we won't be battling the inertia of ignoring 13 years of software upgrades.

## I am a procedural cartographer - to [the tune of the Palace Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvF3Vb0JhA&ab_channel=tomkat69pc)

We feel we must apologise for the lack of [procedure mapping](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) news in recent outings. We recognise that's what our dear reader comes here for. Librarian Jayne has found herself dragged ever Searchwards. Nevertheless, in a small piece of news this week, JO Jane got in touch to ask for the inclusion of a new step in our [statutory instrument maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/#statutory-instrument-procedures).

For instruments laid by the [Department for Work and Pensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions), there is sometimes a requirement under Section [172(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/5/section/172/enacted#section-172-1) and Section [174(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/5/section/174/enacted#section-174-1) of the [Social Security Administration Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/5/contents/enacted) for a report by the [Social Security Advisory Committee](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/social-security-advisory-committee) to also be laid before each House. The Social Security Advisory Committee being an independent statutory body that provides impartial advice on social security and related matters. For instruments laid under [Section 174(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/5/section/174/enacted#section-174-1), there is also a requirement for a statement to be laid by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The report and the statement usually being bundled into one document.

In theory, this is possible for any of the four statutory instrument procedures. In practice, it's only ever happened for [made negatives](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/negative-procedures/made/made-negative.pdf) and [draft affirmatives](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/affirmative-procedures/draft/draft-affirmative.pdf). Not being one to leave knots untied, Jayne has, of course, added to all four procedures, both maps and data. She's also [actualised](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e300) any instances of this having happened since the birth of the SI service, sometime back in 2017. The [Universal Credit (Administrative Earnings Threshold) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2024](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/instrument/ttMue47M/timeline/aaxQ1DdZ) being just one example where you can see her work in action. 

Never being one to side-step best practice, she's also added [a couple of new SPARQL queries](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/instrument-types/statutory-instruments/statutory-instrument-flavours/#instruments-referred-to-the-social-security-advisory-committee). Lovely stuff.

## Facts / figures

This week also saw the release of another revamped publication in the House of Commons Library's [Parliament Facts and Figures series](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/parliament-facts-and-figures/). The latest, primped and preened by Librarian Jayne, is on the subject of [opposition day debates in the House of Commons since 1992](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06315/). Quite the topic and one that caused Jayne's head to spin a little. She even roped in Michael and his superlative whiteboard skills in some attempt to process map the whole thing. That done, we were finally starting to feel comfortable with what Young Robert would doubtless call the "problem space" and even had a first draft of a spreadsheet model mapped out.

Returning to our earlier theme, that is exactly the point at which reality changed, Mr Speaker bringing a [whole new interpretation of procedural rules](https://constitution-unit.com/2024/02/29/the-house-of-commons-row-over-opposition-day-amendments-procedural-background-and-implications/) into play. Back to the drawing board we went, a new model was sketched and finally, the spreadsheet is published. Top work, Jayne.

## Psephologising profusely

With Young Robert on a well-deserved vacation, pixel-polishing of our psephology application has taken something of a back seat. Michael has used the opportunity to scatter seeds of CSVs over our HTML pages, hoping something great will grow when other folks are able to more easily get their hands on the data. As of this week, we have CSVs for the [general election list](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections), [elections in a general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4), [elections in a general election by majority](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/majority), [elections in a general election by vote share of the winning candidate](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/vote-share), [elections in a general election by turnout](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/turnout), [elections in a general election by declaration time](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/declaration-times), [parties contesting elections in a general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/political-parties), [elections contested by a party in a general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/political-parties/3/elections), [elections won by a party in a general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/political-parties/3/elections/won) and [non-party certified candidates in a general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/4/uncertified-candidacies). All of this for both real general elections and notional general elections, but, so far, only at whole of UK level.

With [Statistician Carl](https://bsky.app/profile/carlbaker.bsky.social) also taking a well-deserved vacation, we await his return for general-purpose idiot checking. Once Carl is happy, we'll do all the same for general election listings at country level and general election listings at English region level. Which will be one hell of a lot of CSVs.

We've also added a full-fat general election CSV, listing every candidate in every election and all the scores on the doors. Do fill your boots.

Perhaps the best news is Librarians Anna and Emily have finished up their work tidying and polishing the 2010 election results spreadsheets. Which means we think we're almost ready to add them to the website. There is, however, one slight wiggle still left to deal with. The 2010 election was contested on existing boundaries in [Scotland](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/8), but [England](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/6), [Wales](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/7) and [Northern Ireland](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/5) all saw boundary changes. Which means the result summaries - things like 'Lab gain from Con' and 'Con hold' - and the vote change per party were calculated against notional results. Having never looked at those notional results, Carl has expressed a desire to eyeball them and [double check all our 2010 numbers make sense](https://trello.com/c/kSUJJiaz/241-check-2005-notionals-and-result-summary-and-vote-change-for-2010). Once he's happy, we're happy.

## Content negotiation and caching catastrophes

Dear reader, if you've arrived here for your usual fix of computational procedure wrangling, and take no interest in matters pertaining to the [pedantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), please tune out now. Trust me, you'll thank us. This last bit is more of a note to self, and a note to anyone else who might find themselves caught in a tussle between [content distribution networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) and web standards.

As detailed above, we've been busy adding CSV downloads to our psephology explorations. It is our intention for any HTML page we publish to have an accompanying spreadsheet. In order to grab the spreadsheet, our user need only append .csv to the URL and a CSV will land in their downloads folder. So far, so good. But not without problems.

In order to understand the problems, one needs to know a little about [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) and [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). Sorry. A naive understanding would suggest that a URL locates a document - be that HTML, CSV, XML, JPEG - on a server. Which is sort of true but not how the web is supposed to work. It's possible you've heard us pedantic web types rattle on about HTTP [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)s rather than URLs and thought we were merely pretentious. Trust us, there is a difference here. And an important one at that.

According to the HTTP specification, a URI identifies a [resource](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html) in the abstract. It is possible to dereference an HTTP URI whilst also asking for the representation of the resource you'd prefer. So you can [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) a URI whilst also sending information about the representation or representations you're prepared to accept. This is done by means of [accept headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept). Requesting a URI and saying you only accept HTML should return HTML, if HTML is available. Requesting the same URI and saying you only accept CSV should return a CSV, if a CSV is available. In the world of web science, this is known as [content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation). Or conneg, if you really are feeling pretentious.

Luckily, the [web framework we use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) does this out of the box. Less luckily, the content distribution network we use does not, caching the first response to a URI it sees. So if the cache is clear and the first request accepts only HTML, the HTML gets cached. If the cache is clear and the first request accepts only CSV, the CSV gets cached.

You can probably start to see the problem here. It first surfaced over the weekend, when clicking around the site mostly worked as expected, but, on occasion, clicking a link to another web page did not load that page, but instead downloaded the CSV.

It would appear we have an HTTP-savvy user out there, who was hitting our URIs and accepting only CSVs. Which caused our content distribution network to cache the CSV keyed against the URI. The next visitor in the queue would click the link, expecting more HTML and get the cached CSV instead. This is probably a problem that Michael should have spotted way earlier, having been part of the project team that accidentally served [RDF Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)) to Eastenders fans, for much the same reason.

Investigations were conducted and we came to the rather sad conclusion that our CDN was not conneg compliant and could not easily be configured to be conneg compliant. For that reason, we've now [turned off content negotiation in the psephology web application](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/blob/main/config/initializers/content_negotiation.rb). We'd like to apologise to our HTTP-savvy consumer, and hope that that change has not broken anything at their end too badly. We always hope to be web standards compliant and hate to blame our tools. But what can one do?
