# 2022 - Week 48

Once again, we have let our dear reader down, our so-called weeknotes slipping back into a more fortnightly pattern. For which we apologise. Please rest assured, our noses never venture far from the old grindstone.

## Lovely librarians

The past couple of weeks have been littered with a litany of lovely librarians. Thursday saw the welcome return of [Silver](https://twitter.com/silveroliver) to our fold. He hasn't actually been a librarian for quite some time, but, once you're trained, it never leaves you. Another trek to our Victoria Street offices was undertaken, accompanied, as usual, by entrance issues, unbooked rooms and double-booked rooms. Eventually, both a room and a whiteboard were procured and Silver was at his shiny best, chummering away to librarians Susannah, Katherine and Laura as he attempted to decant their world into physical pixels. Something roughly resembling a [Wardley map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) resulting. Unlike our usual cast of librarians, Susannah, Katherine and Laura lead a team with a more traditional library role, covering such tasks as acquisition, cataloguing, storage, loans and disposal, for both the physical collection and online subscription services. They're also responsible for the Library's digitisation project, which means librarians [Anya](https://mastodon.me.uk/@anyaso) and [Ayesha](https://twitter.com/askalibrarylady), together with their computational colleagues [Young Robert](https://mastodon.me.uk/@robertbrook) and [Michael](https://mastodon.me.uk/@fantasticlife) very much hope they'll get a trip to see [Tom](https://mastodon.me.uk/@derivadow) at some point in the not too distant future.

On the subject of trips, your regular correspondents took the opportunity upon leaving Victoria Street to make an all too rare foray to a public house. I mean, of course they did. A Guinness, perhaps, said Anya and Michael. Obviously. Some vodkas and some tonics, perhaps, said Ayesha. Obviously. Where are the stewed apples, said Ben. Obviously. I wouldn't say no to some bubbly water, said Robert. Obviously.  What's the cheapest red wine you've got, said Silver. Staying in character. They had the good fortune later in the evening - they forget quite when - to be joined by boss brarian Bryn and expert computational expert Ian. At some point in the evening - they forget quite when - Ben's friend Nikki also joined the party. I'm going to marry Nikki, announced Ben at some point in the evening. In fairness, Nikki looked neither shocked nor appalled. So we can only believe Ben is not lying. Congratulations on your impending nuptials Ben. Sorry Nikki.

The week also saw a second meeting with Lords Librarians Ann, Karen and John, and Commons Librarian Andrew to chat back through the deposited paper scribbles we've been slaving over. It turns out that our hunch of [splitting out verb models from noun models](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/making-available/meta/overview.svg) continues to hold true. Which comes as some relief. We traced round every blob and every arrow in the [combined model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/depositing/meta/deposit.pdf) and - following a couple of small tweaks - all present declared themselves happy. Taking that as a green light, we've made a couple of adjustments to our [parliamentary paper model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/parliamentary-paper/parliamentary-paper-ontology) and now have the beginnings of a more [fag-packety](https://smethur.st/posts/176135865) effort to [describe depositing](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/depositing/depositing-ontology). We'd not encourage our dear reader to peruse the comments too closely. They're very much a first pass and probably littered with typos. More next week.

## On matters of modelling

Still on matters of modelling but wandering away from library land, we had our second meeting with Hansard types to fill in a few more gaps in our understanding of whatever it is a procedure might be. This time with the red carpet contingent. We'd like to thank Claire, James and Mark for taking time to talk to us. Whilst our understanding of Hansard progresses, the same cannot be said of our understanding of the 'proceeding' word. It's starting to feel like we may need to play our trump card and call upon [Mr Evans](https://twitter.com/CourtenayIlbert). This being neither a threat nor a promise.

Monday saw Librarian Ned and his computational reserve team, Young Robert and Michael meet Cabinet Office Helen to chat about assorted flavours of Church of England bishops, their bishoprics and how they might find themselves sitting spiritually in the House of Lords. It would appear that only the possession of an English diocesan bishopric counts toward the 'parliamentary seniority ladder' so that clears that up. Another [small start has been made on a model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/bishopric/bishopric.svg) though attempts to turn pixels into [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)) have been put on hold, all parties feeling it might be best to poke some data with some code before putting pens to paper. It does though feel like we're getting somewhere. Albeit slowly. Thanks Helen.

Back in [procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) land, [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) continues to make magnificent progress on turning our [step collection](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e244) scribblings into actual working code. So we should have something to show fairly shortly. For some definition of shortly. And indeed fairly.

## On matters of consent

In the meantime, Librarian Jayne has been busy making use of our Jianhan's previous outing into the wonderful world of working code. As our dear reader will no doubt recall, Jianhan spent quite a bit of time adding [legislatures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e289) to our procedure model. Which meant Jayne was finally free to add [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e175) in our [legislative consent motion maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/#legislative-consent-motions) and assign said steps to the appropriate devolved legislature. This bringing us one step closer to replicating Legislation Office Liam's LCM spreadsheet. Or so we hope.

## Teaching the machines about legislative reform orders

Still in the world of procedure maps, we've also moved one step closer to finally - finally! - getting [legislative reform orders](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/#legislative-reform-order-component-procedures) onto the [statutory instruments website](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/). Yes, we know we say this every week. Yes, we do mean it every week. Yes, we still mean it this week. Yes, we will probably say the same thing next week. We're just optimistic kinda guys. Honestly.

Anyway, to the very best of our knowledge, we've now mapped the full procedure, including a brand new component describing [scrutiny reserve](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/components/dprrc-scrutiny-reserve/dprrc-scrutiny-reserve.pdf) for the [Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/173/delegated-powers-and-regulatory-reform-committee/) - as set out in House of Lords public Standing Order 73 (no anchor link available, sighs) - and the dispensing thereof.

It only remains to [add the new component to the machines](https://trello.com/c/GVhtT0eq/75-dprrc-scrutiny-reserve), double [check our House of Lords debate map with Mr Korris](https://trello.com/c/WupCd1h2/63-idiot-check-lords-debates-with-mk) and - unfortunately for all concerned - check all nine maps to ensure that all the right [routes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e164) link all the right steps. A job that has fallen neatly into the laps of Librarians Jayne and Ayesha. Sorry about that ladies. Truly sorry.

## Interests financial and otherwise

Monday morning kicked off at the unlikely and uncivilised time of 10am as Michael was joined by family friend [Ben](https://twitter.com/benwoodhams) and Registrar Tom to continue chipping away at the [ten House of Lords Register of Members' Interests categories](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/relational/register-of-members-financial-interests/lords/#categories). Eight and a half are now considered done, one and a half to go. At which point, we need to assess what we've scribbled against the [competency questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iRsQBRPChMVFitSGBtNJFGNBvFT8XGKQYYqu40zy_OM/edit?usp=sharing) to check which ones the model can answer. And which ones it can't.

On the subject of such assessments, Wednesday saw Michael once more joined by Ben, alongside House of Commons Registrars James and Thomas, for a pixel-based chat and demo from [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/)' [Giles](https://mastodon.me.uk/@gilesdring) and [Stuart](https://mastodon.me.uk/@slowe). And very good it was too. We commissioned the OI folks to build us a quick prototype allowing the registrars to more easily assess how massaging the features of the model might lead to it answering more questions. Or indeed less. Though that was some time ago. Procurement always proving rather tricky in these parts, we'd started to fear they might have got bored of waiting and decided to plough their own furlough. That could not be further from the truth. The demo takes a feed from our competency questions spreadsheet - applause to Librarian Ayesha, applause to working in the open - and maps each question to feature requirements described as [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files. Availability states are then assigned to combinations of model features; flipping between states lighting up the dashboard like a Christmas tree. Though mostly a red Christmas tree for now. Work continues. Thanks Giles. Thanks Stuart.

## Pivoting to apps

Whilst we remain quite committed to the open web - ask anyone that knows us - it cannot be said to have brought Young Robert and Michael the fame and / or fortune they so richly deserve. For that reason - and probably hoping for a Christmas hit - Young Robert has suggested we pivot to the MacOS native app market. Which does seem quite out of character. Fortunately, the app in question calculates the scrutiny period for assorted instruments before Parliament. Yes, you read correctly, our beloved [egg timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer) is [now available as a native application](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer/meta/app). Which seems very much in character.

In such a competitive market, we're hesitant to give too many of our future plans away. But rest assured, our beloved egg timer may well be on your telephone in the new year. Providing we can find someone daft enough to buy us a development licence.

## Electioneering

Our regular reader will be well aware that election related data is something of a motif for these notes. Though such content usually sticks to a more general election planning theme. This week marks a change of tone as our attentions turned to election data of a more historic nature. A wee while back, Librarian Anya stumbled across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/resulumit/status/1592406551620378624) from [Resul Umit](https://twitter.com/ResulUmit) linking to his [wonderful work compiling UK general election data from 1832 to 2019](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/S83HOA). Thinking the data might be of some use for checking and tidying unsuccessful candidacies in the [Rush database](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/), Michael's taken a copy and made [a sort of website](https://api.parliament.uk/uk-general-elections). Or a "browseable space" as Young Robert might say. There are occasional keying errors on names of things that become apparent when you make the thing browsable, though Resul says he will plans to fix any he spots so we may have a tidier version at some point. It could also use a dash of CSS, not that anyone's asking Robert to give up his weekend. Thanks are due to both Jianhan and Robert for getting the thing deployed to Azure. Not a thing that sparks joy for any of us.

## Fedibots

There are occasions on which people can be quite rude about parliamentary procedure. 'Arcane' they call it. 'Esoteric' they suggest. Quite incorrectly. It's all set out for those who have eyes. It just happens to be a little distributed.

This week we marked another first with the launch of the UK Parliament's first ever fediverse bot account. Or any parliament's to the best of our knowledge. If, like us, you're a refugee from Twitter with an interest in written answers from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, [FCDOAnswers](https://botsin.space/@FCDOAnswers) might be just the thing you're looking for. Who's 'arcane' now, eh?
