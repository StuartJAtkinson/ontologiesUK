# 2022 - Week 30

## Apologies

We begin with apologies. We are well aware that our regular reader starts to worry when we go missing for a week. Four weeks is altogether too long. Unfortunately, a brief warm spell and vacation season got in our way a little. Please rest assured, our combined noses are once more pressed to the proverbial grindstone and we are - as a great man once said - [fit and working again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsBoajapOOk). And [Michael's](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife)'s scuba-diving trips to St Lucia won't pay for themselves.

## All the right steps, not necessarily in the right order

![Eric Morecambe](/eric-morecambe.gif)

Our regular reader - well, JO Jane at least - will be well aware of the issues we've had with step ordering on both the [statutory instrument](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) and [treaty tracking](https://treaties.parliament.uk/) websites. Whilst Parliament may be very good at reporting what happened on a day, what time those things happened at could not be considered a core strength. Both SI and treaty procedure regularly see a number of [procedural steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e175) happening on the same day. But with no timing information available, the website code has no clue what order they happened in and no clue how to order them for display. With nothing to go on and no clues given, our timeline pages have been - to be quite frank - risible, steps being ordered at random in a fashion that matches neither procedural nor common sense. The example below - from the [Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/instrument/Mips7NQF/) - has the instrument being approved by the House of Lords, before the question on the approval motion is put, before the non-fatal amendment to the motion is rejected, before the question on the non-fatal amendment is put, before there's even been a debate. Which is pretty much as topsy turvy as you could get.

![A wonky timeline as described above](/wonky.png)

Early attempts to fix this problem saw us taking a mathematical approach and spanning the procedure map tree. But [a graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is not a tree, so that didn't work. In recent weeks, we changed tack, stopped treating the problem as some sums and started to treat it as yet more information management. Librarian Jayne and her computational handmaidens, Young Robert and Michael, added a new concept of [step depth](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e289) to our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) and [procedure editor schema](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/meta/editor/schema.svg). [Our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) added new functionality to the procedure editor application, database and triple store. Jayne added step depths to both [maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) and data. Jianhan chipped back in with a new SPARQL query to order timelines through a combination of dates and step depths. Colleagues in Software Engineering deployed Jianhan's new query to their Q/A environment. And - following a wee bit of [additional tinkering](https://trello.com/c/NxYe57Nb/113-error-in-orchestrations) - testing revealed the new model, data and query worked. Perfectly. Quite a first for us.

Since then, Jianhan has done all the same work in live, Librarian Jayne has added step depths to the rest of our procedures and Software Engineering have deployed the new query to live. Which means the timeline for the instrument mentioned above now has a debate taking place before the question on the non-fatal amendment being put, before the non-fatal amendment to the motion is rejected, before the question on the approval motion is put, before the approval motion is approved.

Much less ridiculous, as we're sure you'll agree. And yet more proof - as if proof were needed - that putting domain knowledge, modelling, mapping and information management in the same place is the only reasonable approach to making things with computers. It is at this point that we smile sweetly at JO Jane and suggest a pint. Perhaps.

## On matters of mapping

Map making met something of an impasse when Librarian Jayne and her computational helpmate Michael found themselves mightily confused about when motions might be tabled in the [legislative reform order procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/#legislative-reform-order). And, more importantly, when they might not. Neither [legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/51/part/1/crossheading/procedure) nor standing orders offered much in the way of help. And - because this is not a procedure that gets called upon too often - precedence wasn't much help either. Our regular reader may well recall us dispatching an email in the general direction of House of Commons Mike and House of Lords [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattKorris). We had hoped - our primitive monkey brains craving symmetry - that the red carpet contingent and the green carpet contingent might agree. Sadly, that was not to be the case.

Commons Mike got back to say he'd be minded to hold off on the tabling of any motions until the [procedure determination phase](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/51/part/1/crossheading/procedure#section-15) was complete. Not that we would ever distrust Mike, but [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and Michael happened to catch the eye of [Mr Evans](https://twitter.com/CourtenayIlbert) over a pint in the Strangers' Bar and decided second opinions are never wasted. Luckily Paul concurred with Mike, leaving Anya, Michael - and we assume Mike - rather pleased. It would be tricky to come to a different procedural conclusion to Paul and then attempt to defend it.

First hurdle cleared, we were delighted to hear back from Lords Matt. At least until we opened the email. Unfortunately, in terms of our eyesight and wellbeing, the red carpet folks came to a quite different position, suggesting they would accept the tabling of motions particular to the procedure recommended by the Minister from the point of laying. And well before the point of procedure determination. This position also being backed by JO Jane. Reader, we cannot deny we sighed a little.

All of which leaves our LRO map making smashed into matchstick-sized pieces that we're currently trying to reassemble into something suggestive of sanity. The Lords' motion to take note has been stripped from the negative side of the procedure and added to the Lords' half of the [main map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/legislative-reform-orders/legislative-reform-order.pdf). The tabling of five more types of motion - fatal and non-fatals in the negative procedure and the approval motion and its fatal and non-fatal amendments - will all need to be added to the main map. Meaning our core procedure map - which had been fair of face in its symmetry - starts to look somewhat deformed. Like the Lords' half has developed a boil perhaps.

Still we plough on. And now with renewed vigour. It has been suggested that the [LRO procedure might well be called into use in the Government's quest to repeal legislation retained from our European Union days](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/22941/documents/168244/default/). So getting the procedure mapped and instruments subject to the procedure onto the statutory instruments website takes on a new urgency. Stay tuned as we keep on keeping on.

Not all LRO news was bad news. Jayne and Michael were delighted to be joined by House of Lords Philipp who very kindly signed off their [map of committee consideration in the Lords](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/legislative-reform-orders/components/lords/committee-consideration/committee-consideration.pdf). Another ticket moving to the done pile. 

Elsewhere a couple of dawning realisations have dawned, as dawning realisations often do. The definition of done being something of a moving target. Especially in this place. Rather late in the day, we realised we'd tied the hands of our [draft negative procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/negative-procedures/draft/draft-negative.pdf) rather too tightly, both map and data stating the withdrawal of such an instrument would result in an inability to put the question on a non-fatal motion. As any fule kno, there is no preclusion from withdrawal to questions on a non-fatal. So [that knot has now been loosened](https://trello.com/c/efJLVrLA/319-negative-instrument-question-can-be-put-on-a-non-fatal-regardless-of-withdrawal-need-to-remove-routes).

Still in the [negative procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/#negative-procedures) and still on the question of knots, we also realised that we'd not tied a couple of them quite tightly enough. Both our draft and [made negative](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/negative-procedures/made/made-negative.pdf) maps allowed for the tabling of fatal motions even after one - or other - House had approved a fatal. That is also now [fixed](https://trello.com/c/mSWWifAE/316-negative-conditions-for-fatal-motions-do-we-need-to-make-tabling-conditional-on-an-instrument-not-being-dead-via-fatal-motion).

Over in treaty land, ongoing [scrutiny of the Australia free trade agreement](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/snzFSs5u/CP-689/) led to more patching of patchwork. The [Joint Committee on Human Rights](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/93/human-rights-joint-committee/) gained [an additional step in the form of a government response](https://trello.com/c/r8T3doL3/513-treaties-jchr-add-govt-response-step). Why that wasn't already there we have no idea. Adding complications, the [International Trade Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/367/international-trade-committee/) only went and reported twice. So new steps have been added to describe their [preliminary report and associated outcomes](https://trello.com/c/QiHVuf44/510-itc-treaties-itc-has-considered-a-treaty-twice-need-to-remove-the-self-preclusion-of-reporting). The granting of an [urgent question in the House of Commons on the subject of the same FTA](https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/Document/58627/Html?subType=Standard#20220719-10) led to [the addition of yet another new step](https://trello.com/c/z3G0Cd0n/519-treaty-procedure-urgent-question-on-australia-agreement). And finally, [routes to the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee steps have been added](https://trello.com/c/ThVWZGT2/514-treaties-lords-committees-add-slsc-steps-routes-to-data). Routes that were always present in the maps but that Jayne and Michael plain forgot to add the data. Oops.

Absolutely finally, [Ellie](https://twitter.com/ellie_hourigan) and [Lucinda](https://twitter.com/LucindaMaer) got in touch requesting a new step to cover occasions on which the JCHR might wish to recommend the Government reconsider the drafting of a [proposed draft remedial order](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/remedial-orders/proposed-draft-remedial-order/proposed-draft-remedial-order.pdf). An [eventuality that occurred](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtrights/280/summary.html) in their scrutiny of the [draft State Immunity Act 1978 (Remedial) Order 2022](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/instrument/BN2qPIIK/timeline/1QpBJkVR/). That step is now both added and [actualised](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e334).

## On matters of modelling

It's not every week we have a new model to announce. Luckily you tuned in on the just the right week. Our curtain rises with our brand new [parliamentary paper model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/parliamentary-paper/parliamentary-paper-ontology) standing shyly in the spotlight. It's based on the bottom half of the [relational laid papers schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukparliament/ontologies/master/meta/relational/laid-papers/laid-papers.svg) that librarians Anya, Jayne and Ned and computational 'experts' Robert and Michael have been cobbling together with much needed help from librarian Corie, House of Lords Kath, House of Commons Robi and [TNA](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/)'s very own Helen. We'd like to thank them all very much. This model doesn't describe how papers actually arrive in Parliament. Next week we hope to have a rejigged [making available model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/making-available/making-available-ontology) and - once that's done - a revised [laying model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/laying/laying-ontology) to glue the two halves together. Stay tuned.

Elsewhere in whiteboard land, our [parliamentary time period model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/time-period/time-period-ontology) has gone through yet another respray. For what must be the thousandth time. This time we think we're finally happy. Though we have said that before. The latest version moves [recesses](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/time-period/time-period-ontology#d4e245) out from being a time period belonging directly to a [session](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/time-period/time-period-ontology#d4e205) and instead makes a recess merely a grouping of [adjournment days](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/time-period/time-period-ontology#d4e232). Adjournment days themselves belonging directly to a session. All of which means we can now populate the whole of the model - recesses aside - from data already collected for [egg timing](https://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) purposes. Lovely. It's possible - we suspect - that we can get away with never having to model the concept of a recess. But that rather depends on whether there's a ruleset we can apply defining how a given pattern of adjournment days constitutes a recess. If anyone out there feels able to explain when a set of adjourned days becomes a recess, we'd be quite delighted to hear from you. Especially if your explanation stands a chance of making sense to computers.

Ned, Robert and Michael have finally finished off the comments on our [election model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/election/election-ontology). As ever, you're encouraged to take a peep. It may well not stand up to the scrutiny of a dedicated psephologist. It certainly won't stand up to the keen eye of a [Sym Roe](https://twitter.com/symroe). But it feels like a decent enough framework. And there's always tomorrow to make things better. 

## On matters of information management

Exciting developments in the world of peerages have continued to excite. Librarian and Wikimedian [Andrew](https://twitter.com/generalising) has added a couple of new properties to Wikidata: one to point to [Beamish peerage IDs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P10848), the other to point to [Beamish person IDs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P10849). There's also [a new Mix 'n' Match service](https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/#/catalog/5308) to help automate and crowdsource equivalence between peerage concepts in our database and peerage concepts in Wikidata. So, if you're a big fan of peerages, please do dive in and help make the web a better and more connected place. Thanks, as ever, Andrew.

In other peerage news, Librarian Ned continues on his mission to populate [our peerage database](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/) with more people and more peerages from the work of [John Sainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sainty_(parliamentary_official)). Ned's been re-reading Sainty's notes and it turns out that - much as Beamish extends Sainty - Sainty extends William Hardy's "Lists of Creations of Peers and Baronets, compiled from Original Documents in the Public Record Office" published in 1886 as an appendix to the Public Records Office annual report. Obviously, [the original is at Kew](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C12082) but there's a [scanned copy online](https://archive.org/details/annualreportdep00offigoog/page/n551) (appendix 6, starting at p78 of 403). The Hardy listings would get us back to 1483 for both England and Ireland. Hardy in turn extends the "Reports from the Lords Committee appointed to search the Journals of the House, Roll of Parliament, and other Records and Documents for all matters touching the Dignity of a Peer of the Realm", published in 1819, and going back to 1135, predating both modern peerages and Parliament itself. We're told that Hardy isn't as straightforward to transcribe as Sainty but it does includes things that are not new creations of peerages by [letters patent](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e179). On the plus side it's in English, and it takes the same approach as Sainty and Beamish, referring to primary sources rather than just copying secondary references. A good candidate for inclusion we think.

Fans of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 will be well aware that [part 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2) sets out the procedure for treaties laid before Parliament pre-ratification. They'll also be well aware that [section 22 of part 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2#section-22) provides a scrutiny escape hatch. So long as neither House has already resolved that the treaty should not be ratified, it is always an option for the Minister to make a statement invoking section 22 that section 20 does not apply. Whilst the invocation of section 22 has always been part of our [CRaG treaty procedure map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/treaties/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf), until quite recently, it had never been actualised. Then along came a couple of treaties covering the accession of [Finland](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/4zjttv9m/CP-730/) and [Sweden](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/AZ3TnHDL/CP-731/) to NATO. The government called upon section 22 and [Librarian Ayesha](https://twitter.com/askalibrarylady) set about actualising. Unfortunately, neither our treaty nor SI websites allow for aggregation by actualised steps - no 'click here' to see all the occasions on which this procedural thing has happened.  Or indeed has not happened. For this reason, librarians Jayne and Ayesha have made a brand new SPARQL query listing [all the treaties we've indexed where the section 22 steps have been actualised](https://api.parliament.uk/s/25128ba0). Much neater.

Attempts to tidy the address data in the Members' Names Information Service continue. Librarian Phil has exported a list of addresses where the [telephone field contains the text 'fax'](https://trello.com/c/cACLfIrE/35-get-a-list-of-addresses-and-associated-member-where-the-telephone-field-contains-the-string-fax). Should any of those addresses belong to current Members, Librarian Emily is planning to get in touch with them and [ask if they're still valid](https://trello.com/c/NyvExL0e/36-contact-current-members-to-check-they-still-want-fax-listed-where-fax-is-present-in-telephone-field). Well, it's cheaper than buying a fax machine.

Quite astonishing progress has been made by Librarian Anna and computational expert [James](https://twitter.com/jamesjefferies) on fettling our [Rush database](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/), Anna on tidying duties, James on normalisation. One thing that had been tripping us up - even post-tidying and normalisation - were strings with trailing spaces being saved into the database. James has now added an [an ActiveModel extension that strips out leading and trailing spaces automagically](https://github.com/rmm5t/strip_attributes). So that's gonna save a lot of time and trouble. In terms of tidying and normalisation, we now have lists for [parliament types](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/parliament_types), [highest offices attained](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/highest_offices) and [who's who volumes](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/whos_who_volumes). Lovely stuff with more to follow during Summer Recess we hope.
