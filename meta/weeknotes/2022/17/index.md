# 2022 - Week 17

## Bot farming

Our regular reader will of course be aware of - and indeed following, one hopes - both [made-n-laid](https://twitter.com/madenlaid) and [tweatytwacker](https://twitter.com/tweatytwacker) - our earlier dabblings into Twitter automation. This week our family of bots expanded to incorporate five new accounts that tweet whenever an answering body provides a written answer - or a correction to an earlier answer - to a parliamentary question:

* [@DCMSAnswers](https://twitter.com/DCMSAnswers) covering the [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport)

* [@DITAnswers](https://twitter.com/DITAnswers) for the [Department for International Trade](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-trade)

* [@FCDOAnswers](https://twitter.com/FCDOAnswers) for [Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office)

* [@GEO_Answers](https://twitter.com/GEO_Answers) for the [Government Equalities Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-equalities-office)

* [@LUHCAnswers](https://twitter.com/LUHCAnswers) for the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities)

[A thread](https://twitter.com/bitten_/status/1519058552098377735) from [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) explains more and comes complete with a [call for interest](https://twitter.com/bitten_/status/1519059922893352960) in other [answering bodies](https://written-questions.herokuapp.com/answering-bodies) our users might like to see botified. [David](https://twitter.com/dkernohan) was the first - and indeed only - reader to [join the queue](https://twitter.com/dkernohan/status/1519073675005288449), which means, by late Friday we'd added [@DFEAnswers](https://twitter.com/DFEAnswers) for all your educational needs.

As your correspondents type @FCDOAnswers has already gained 65 followers. Including at least two [APPG](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/apg/)s and a small number of people who seem to work for the FCDO. Which is not bad for a set of accounts launched in a pub on Tuesday.

Not content with syndicating to Twitter - and with his finger poised, as ever, on the pulse of the zeitgeist - young Robert has jumped in to further syndicate from Twitter to Mastodon. How modern are we?

## Proro-horror-gation

No sooner did we emerge refreshed and reinvigorated from Easter recess eager than Parliament prorogued. Or rather, Parliament [was prorogued](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf). As has become tradition, Librarian Jayne took this as her opportunity to publish our own take on [statutory instrument related sessional returns](https://twitter.com/madenlaid/status/1519678119543812096). Again in the form of a tweet thread. A tweet thread that proved quite ridiculously popular. We do not kid ourselves that we're working with mass market material here, so a tweet thread about SI statistics gaining 13 retweets and 50 - count 'em - likes, is not to be sniffed at. By late Friday the followers count for made-n-laid had jumped by 150 and passed 500 mark. This to include at least one Whips Office, a handful of Members, a scattering of Members' staff, a collection of clerks, a profusion of professors and a quorum of QCs. Now anyone that knows us will know that we are not stats and graphs type people. All efforts at measurement tending toward the what can be measured because what's useful to measure is usually too difficult. Nevertheless, 500+ followers for an account tweeting SIs does feel quite remarkable and strengthens Jayne's resolve to continue on her quest to be the world's shyest social media superstar. Though she has threatened to quit if the number tops 1000. So please don't all rush in.

Prorogation is not just an opportunity to recap though. It also brings work. But you know us. Never shy of a decent day's graft. Which is why Tuesday found Jayne, Robert and Michael hunched over pixels, prodding at database tables to make our beloved [egg timer of parliamentary procedure](https://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) prorogation proof. Which only left poor Jayne lumbered with the thankless task of updating end dates for instruments before Parliament. It's not all glamour and Instagram.

## [You've just given me your last Standing Orders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDIdTC62rQs)

A wee while back we struck gold when boss brarian Bryn managed to conjure up cash to turn our [standing order prototype](https://api.parliament.uk/standing-orders) into something more editable. This week, Anya, Jayne and Michael got their first glimpse of the new system, joining [James](https://twitter.com/jamesjefferies) for a pixel based demo. And very good it was too. Very good. Really, really pleasing. James has taken Michael's [shonky Ruby code](https://github.com/ukparliament/standing-orders), sped it up quite considerably, added users accounts and made all the tables editable. And not just this. You can now take a [revision set](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontology.html#d4e107), press a 'clone' button and the whole [set of standing orders](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontology.html#d4e118) and [every fragment in them](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontology.html#d4e141) gets copied into a whole new tree. In less time than it took Michael's code to render a list. We're not yet in a position where we can show you work in progress. And even when we are, you'll miss the nifty edit and clone stuff but, needless to say we are pleased. 

So pleased in fact that Michael has since prodded [Rad](https://radoslawzubek.com/) and [Tom](https://twitter.com/tomgfleming) from the [research team](https://parlrulesdata.org/) that first donated the standing order data and asked if they might want to use the same system for their work in other legislatures. Tom has kindly offered to sense check the editing interface. And given he has more experience in compiling this data than anyone, that would definitely not be time wasted. 

## Return to public bill mountain

Recent conversations with Legislation Office Liam and Katya pointed to our [House of Commons first reading map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/commons/first-reading/first-reading.pdf) being rather too busy. That has now been cleared out and is once more back to bare bones.

First to get decanted from the first reading map was the [fast tracking of second reading](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/commons/fast-track-second-reading/fast-track-second-reading.pdf). Something that can apparently happen in one of two ways: by an allocation of time motion if no other provisions are required or by a Business of the House motion if they are. What those other provisions might be, how they may impact on other areas of the maps and whether they might lend themselves to enumeration remains a question for next week. Luckily, Legislation Office Huw has kindly offered to step in and lend us his brains. Thanks Huw.

The second thing to get decanted was [examination for hybridity](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/commons/examination-and-standing-orders-committee/examination-and-standing-orders-committee.pdf) which is not only in its own map but also incorporates feedback from Legislation Office Katya and tidies up a few of our sillier mistakes. Hopefully, next week should see our homework marked and gold stars all round. Hopefully.

## Step depth preparations

In procedure editor news, [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) has been preparing the ground for adding step depth to our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html). This has been a long, long, long time coming and will - we hope - finally fix the problem with step ordering on both the [statutory instrument](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) and [treaty](https://treaties.parliament.uk/) websites. A problem we have explained at some considerable length - weeknotes passim. Please forgive a brief recap. Our crack team of librarians capture the date on which a [business item](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e211) took place, but not the time. Partly because capturing the time would be a little more work but mainly because we often lack access to that information or it just isn't captured. This has led to business items happening on the same day being listed in a fashion that could not be described as 'procedural'. We've seen snaggles such as 'approved by both Houses' appearing just above the 'approved by the House of Lords'. So our problems are not limited to the procedurally inappropriate but also the frankly illogical. Jianhan's work sets the scene for steps to be given a [depth in a procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e289) which will - we hope - be used to order them for display. But that is a little way off. We know the plan, we just need to get there.

## Fettling Rush

Over in the world of the [Rush database](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/), Librarian Anna has taken a break from normalising things and backfilled a by election or two. Which means we now have records for [Sarah Green](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/members/10326), [Jill Mortimer](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/members/10328), [Anum Qaisar](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/members/10315) and [Kim Leadbeater](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/members/10327). Top work, Anna.

Meanwhile, mid-level boss brarian Anya noticed that we had two Members blessed with an [honorific](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/honorifics) of 'The' which she found questionable. Upon further investigation, it turned out said Members also has a surname of "O'Conor Don". Luckily, [Wikipedia came to the rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_O%27Conor_Don) and we now know that O'Conor Don is a title bestowed on the head of the O'Conor clan. Which may well be Gaelic nobility but - we believe - does not fall into the bucket marked aristocratic. So the aristocratic checkbox remains unticked. The honorific 'The' has been binned and the Don added as a title in the alternative name table. Which we think does the job. Whether or not there might be an O'Somerville Don remains a matter for ancestry.com
