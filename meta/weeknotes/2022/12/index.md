## A single subject view of The Library. Or toward an information architecture

Librarians [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_), [Silver](https://twitter.com/silveroliver), Ned and [Phil](https://twitter.com/philbgorman) continue to prod away at providing House of Commons Library researchers, front of house librarians, Members and their staff with a single-subject view of Library inputs, processes and outputs. The better to gather all relevant material pertinent to an enquiry in one place. The current state of things is, erm, well, somewhat messy. Let's just leave it at somewhat messy.

Enquiries - the bread and butter of Library services - are not subject indexed at all. Occasionally, a librarian or researcher may attach a free-text tag or two. But there's process that one might describe as systematic in place. [Research Briefings](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/), on the other hand, get subject indexed three times against three different vocabularies. First time by the authors against a short list of topic terms derived from - but forked from - the [Parliament Thesaurus](https://explore.data.parliament.uk/?endpoint=terms). The second time is not really an indexing, more a munging of topic terms into a new shape to make the [Wordpress website category pages](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research/). And the third time when team:Anya take out fine toothcombs and index everything against the Thesaurus proper.

Over in the world of the physical book collection, a team once managed by our Phil also subject index acquisitions, again against the full Parliament Thesaurus. Elsewhere, another team scour the web for useful articles and subject index them with free text terms.

But this is not where the subject indexing of things stops. The Library researchers are also subject indexed. In a fashion. The subject specialist directory is a list of Library specialists indexed against their specialisms. Actually, two lists, but lets skip over that. It gets sent out to front of house Library staff, Members and Members' staff as a sort of Yellow Pages for those in the market for a legal or constitutional expert. Rather than, say, a plumber. Two lists means two different taxonomies, again not integrated with any of the other taxonomies.

Now one does not need to be a [Wardley mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) obsessive to see there's some redundancy in this system. Almost worse than redundancy, it's also a system with sizeable gaps in both coverage and interoperability.  It's rather like a library indexing its hardbacks against [Library of Congress subject headings](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First) and its softbacks against [Universal Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification) and wondering why no one can find anything. But if the railway system could fix [breaks of gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_of_gauge), a library can damn sure fix breaks in subject indexing.

Not that fixing the railways was a trivial matter. If someone wanted to build their railway to 4 ft 8 1⁄2, and some other chap decided that 7 ft 1⁄4 would provide a more comfortable travelling experience, there was little anyone could do to knock heads together and bang out a deal. It was only when the railways stopped being systems and started to become a system of systems that carting barrels of beer from one train to another started to feel a little labour intensive. And this, dear reader, is a long drawn out metaphor for how software is built. And more importantly commissioned. Only when you wrap your head round the fact that you're not commissioning a system, but rather a component in a larger system, do economies of scale start to happen and your individual investments start to yield dividends that are larger than their sum of their parts.

Our crack team of librarians have spent the last few months busying themselves with building a prototype that integrates the many and varied taxonomies and brings much of the information together. Ned has been churning out spreadsheets to index specialists with concepts from the Parliament Thesaurus, Silver has been hand indexing a sample set of enquiries against the same vocabulary and Anya has been squeezing indexed Research Briefings out of Parliamentary Search. All of which has found a home in a nifty little data integration tool that Silver's colleagues at [Data Language](https://datalanguage.com/) have put together. The team are now inching toward the conclusion of the project, presenting findings and heading into report writing territory. Unfortunately, we can't share the report with you yet. Because (a) it isn't finished and (b) no one's read it yet. We can, however, [share some slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i1kaZCFS1D3ngV0M86bqQxDBzAyapSaMbCPSNTTviqU/edit?usp=sharing) and end on the usual note that feedback is always welcome.
