# 2023 - Week 4

A quick update on what everyone's favourite team of crack librarians and computational experts have been up to this week.

## Kind hearts / coronets

Librarian Ned has been hard at work backfilling [peerage holding](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e112) information for all peerages held by a current Member of the House of Lords. Our [peerage database](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/) started life when [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) very kindly donated [his data](http://www.peerages.info/) describing creations in the [UK Peerage](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/5/letters_patents) by [Letters Patent](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e179) since 1801. Since then, Ned has been putting in the legwork visiting libraries and archives to expand the dataset to include Letters Patent peerage creations in the Kingdoms of [Great Britain](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/4/letters_patents), [England](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/1/letters_patents), [Ireland](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/3/letters_patents) and [Scotland](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/2/letters_patents). Marvellous work!

By way of background, the creation of a peerage is usually affirmed by the issuing of a Letters Patent to its first holder. The Letters Patent may be accompanied by a [Special Remainder](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e101) if the peerage is hereditary in nature and the usual rules of inheritance - down the male lineage - don't apply. As a database of peerage creations, the initial dataset only contained information on the first holder of any hereditary peerage. Obviously, being Parliament, we also have reason to care about subsequent holders. So Ned has also busied himself backfilling information for subsequent holders of hereditary peerages for any peerage with a holder who's also described in [MNIS](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/). These may be hereditary peers now departed from the Lords, hereditary peers sitting as [elected excepted peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-elections_to_the_House_of_Lords) and people sitting as life peers who also happen to hold an hereditary title. One example of the latter case being [Douglas Hogg](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/people/2837) who served as a Member of the Commons from 1997 - 2010, inherited the [Viscountcy Hailsham](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/963) and the [Barony Hailsham](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/943) in 2001, before being granted [Letters Patent](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/letters_patents/2966) as [Lord Hailsham of Kettlethorpe](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/2840) in 2015. Quite a career and quite a good test case.

And not just this. The House of Lords does not stand still. So Librarians Anna, Emily and Ned have also been working out how we keep on top of new arrivals. Bishops aside, there are two routes for arrival into the Lords: by virtue of a Life Peerage, where the holder may also be in possession of an hereditary title and by election as an excepted hereditary. Team:IDMS already have workflows in place for new arrivals. These workflows have now expanded. The Life Peerage case is relatively trivial. A Letters Patent affirms its creation and its holder will subsequently be [summoned to the Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/writ-of-summons/). The only tricky part arising for the minority of Life Peers who also hold an hereditary title. Like Viscount Hailsham. In such cases, the peerage holding records for the hereditary title will also be backfilled if this has not already happened. Elections for excepted hereditaries are trickier, but luckily there's a [register of potential candidates](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/house-of-lords-publications/records-of-activities-and-membership/register-of-all-hereditary-peers/) for future elections. So, ever prepared and ever preparing, Ned has also backfilled peerage holdings for those peerages.

And that's where we were until this week. Unfortunately, there is another route to peerage creation. One that resident computational "expert" Michael did not spot until the database was designed the application was built. It turns out that there are occasions on which a person has been in receipt of a writ of summons to the Lords without ever having been given a peerage. At this point, some notion of infallibility enters the picture and it is said that the necessary peerage has been created 'by writ'. Or 'by accident' as Michael might say. Such peerages are also assumed to be hereditary, following standard rules of inheritance. Which means we have 27 current Members of the House of Lords in possession of a peerage created 'by writ'. Our peerage database was designed on the assumption that a Letters Patent can affirm the creation of one or more peerages - always to the same person - and a peerage is always affirmed by the issuing of a Letters Patent. Which, in the case of 'by writ', just isn't true.

Luckily, we work with [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) and James is never not helpful. So we got in touch about adding a [new Boolean](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e867) to record peerages created 'by writ', a [dollop of nullability](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e443) on the requirement for peerages to be accompanied by a Letters Patent and a side requirement to record when the date of a Letters Patent is both [unknown and unknowable](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e776). By some miracle, that work is now done. Which means, with a fair wind, Librarian Ned should be able to add peerage holding records for all current Members no matter how their peerage was created.

Top work Ned. Top work James. A proper pair of marvels.
