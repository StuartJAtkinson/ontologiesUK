# 2023 - Week 4

A quick update on what everyone's favourite team of crack librarians and computational experts have been up to this week.

## Kind hearts / coronets

Librarian Ned has been hard at work backfilling [peerage holding](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e112) information for all peerages held by a current Member of the House of Lords. Our [peerage database](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/) started life when [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) very kindly donated [his data](http://www.peerages.info/) describing creations in the [UK Peerage](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/5/letters_patents) by [Letters Patent](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e179) since 1801. Since then, Ned has been putting in the legwork visiting libraries and archives to expand the dataset to include Letters Patent peerage creations in the Kingdoms of [Great Britain](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/4/letters_patents), [England](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/1/letters_patents), [Ireland](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/3/letters_patents) and [Scotland](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/kingdoms/2/letters_patents). Marvellous work!

By way of background, the creation of a peerage is usually affirmed by the issuing of a Letters Patent to its first holder. The Letters Patent may be accompanied by a [Special Remainder](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e101) if the peerage is hereditary in nature and the usual rules of inheritance - down the male lineage - don't apply. As a database of peerage creations, the initial dataset only contained information on the first holder of any hereditary peerage. Obviously, being Parliament, we also have reason to care about subsequent holders. So Ned has also busied himself backfilling information for subsequent holders of hereditary peerages for any peerage with a holder who's also described in [MNIS](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/). These may be hereditary peers now departed from the Lords, hereditary peers sitting as [elected excepted peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-elections_to_the_House_of_Lords) and people sitting as life peers who also happen to hold an hereditary title. One example of the latter case being [Douglas Hogg](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/people/2837) who served as a Member of the Commons from 1997 - 2010, inherited the [Viscountcy Hailsham](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/963) and the [Barony Hailsham](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/943) in 2001, before being granted [Letters Patent](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/letters_patents/2966) as [Lord Hailsham of Kettlethorpe](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/peerages/2840) in 2015. Quite a career and quite a good test case.

And not just this. The House of Lords does not stand still. So Librarians Anna, Emily and Ned have also been working out how we keep on top of new arrivals. Bishops aside, there are two routes for arrival into the Lords: by virtue of a Life Peerage, where the holder may also be in possession of an hereditary title and by election as an excepted hereditary. Team:IDMS already have workflows in place for new arrivals. These workflows have now expanded. The Life Peerage case is relatively trivial. A Letters Patent affirms its creation and its holder will subsequently be [summoned to the Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/writ-of-summons/). The only tricky part arising for the minority of Life Peers who also hold an hereditary title. Like Viscount Hailsham. In such cases, the peerage holding records for the hereditary title will also be backfilled if this has not already happened. Elections for excepted hereditaries are trickier, but luckily there's a [register of potential candidates](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/house-of-lords-publications/records-of-activities-and-membership/register-of-all-hereditary-peers/) for future elections. So, ever prepared and ever preparing, Ned has also backfilled peerage holdings for those peerages.

And that's where we were until this week. Unfortunately, there is another route to peerage creation. One that resident computational "expert" [Michael](https://mastodon.me.uk/@fantasticlife) did not spot until the database was designed and the application was built. It turns out that there are occasions on which a person has been in receipt of a writ of summons to the Lords without ever having been given a peerage. At this point, some notion of infallibility enters the picture and it is said that the necessary peerage has been created 'by writ'. Or 'by accident' as Michael might say. Such peerages are also assumed to be hereditary, following standard rules of inheritance. Which means we have 20-odd current Members of the House of Lords in possession of a peerage created 'by writ'. Our peerage database was designed on the assumption that a Letters Patent can affirm the creation of one or more peerages - always to the same person - and a peerage is always affirmed by the issuing of a Letters Patent. Which, in the case of 'by writ', just isn't true.

Luckily, we work with [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) and James is never not helpful. So we got in touch about adding a [new Boolean](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e867) to record peerages created 'by writ', a [dollop of nullability](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e443) on the requirement for peerages to be accompanied by a Letters Patent and a side requirement to record when the date of a Letters Patent is both [unknown and unknowable](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e776). By some miracle, that work is now done. Which means, with a fair wind, Librarian Ned should be able to add peerage holding records for all current Members, no matter how their peerage was created.

Top work Ned. Top work James. A proper pair of marvels.

In other peerage related news, investigations continue on where we might find reliable records of House of Lords by-elections. And, should we find them, how we interlink candidates listed with peerage database person identifiers. Stay tuned!

## Procedure mapping

Two items of procedure mapping news this week. Neither of them really news.

Thursday saw an in-pixel meeting between JO Jayne, Librarian Jayne and computational midshipman Michael. Having recently polished off [remedial order](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/#remedial-orders) and [legislative reform order](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/#legislative-reform-order) procedure maps, our crack team of cartographers were keen to learn what JO Jane thought they should map next. Way back in time, when wrinkles still lay in our future, the threesome had taken time out to draw up a sketch of [assorted instruments and which procedure they trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukparliament/ontologies/master/legislation/delegated-legislation/delegated-legislation.svg). If any. Where should we go next? we asked. [Localism orders](https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/articles/0jFPWpQS/localism-orders), [public body orders](https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/articles/db4pAIeE/public-bodies-orders) and instruments subject to the pre-Stormont Northern Ireland procedure being the top candidates. Do nowt, JO Jane answered, quite unexpectedly. None of the remaining procedures ever having been used much and being mostly defunct. So that saves time and trouble. Not that we left the meeting short of work. Be on your guard for the mapping of new procedures that may - or may not - emerge from the passage of the [Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3340) and the [Northern Ireland Protocol Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3182), JO Jane advised. We remain on standby.

The only other related news concerns some small updates to our [design notes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/), in which the combined brains of Librarian Jayne and computational all-rounders [Young Robert](https://mastodon.me.uk/@robertbrook) and Michael attempted to wrap braincells around the thorny issues of [procedural clocks](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#clocks), [step collections](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#step-collections) and - thorniest of all - [whether or not a step forms part of a procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#business-steps-as-part-of-a-procedure). The latter effort being something of a cop-out. Knowing where a procedure ends and what should form part of it requiring bigger brains than proved to be available.

## On matters of consent

Having little left to do - for now - in the world of secondary legislation, we decided to turn our attentions back to [primary legislation](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/) in general and [legislative consent motions](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/#legislative-consent-motions) in particular. We're on some kind of promise to Legislation Office Liam to take on some of the workload around tracking LCM procedure in the devolved legislatures. To which end, we've been mapping out procedures in collaboration with colleagues in [Belfast](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/northern-ireland-assembly/northern-ireland-assembly-consent.pdf), [Edinburgh](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/scottish-parliament/scottish-parliament-consent.pdf) and [Cardiff](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/senedd-cymru/senedd-cymru-consent.pdf). Before we can put those maps to use, there's both modelling and mapping work to do. 

Given we're in bill land and a bill is a parliamentary paper, we now have a revised version of our [papers model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/paper/paper-ontology). That said, our mental Venn of papers and parliamentary papers is still more than a little fuzzy. If you're a clerk, you see us coming down a corridor and you really don't fancy a conversation about papers, it might be best to scarper.

On top of the papers model, Librarians [Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite) and Jayne and part-time scribe Michael have also been applying tweaks to our [bill model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/bill/bill-ontology). This time with a more FRBR-like flavour. It still needs a layer of comments before it makes much sense. And even then, your mileage may vary.

Next steps - we think - are working out what needs to change in the [procedure editor database](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/meta/editor/schema.svg) to cope with bills and which bits of the bill procedure maps we need inside the machines for our LCM tracking use-case. More next week.

## A Wellcome trip

At some point before Christmas we'd been joined by [Silver](https://twitter.com/silveroliver) for a whiteboard session with Librarians Katharine and Susannah. The whiteboard was mainly filled with matters of acquisition, cataloguing, retrieval, lending, storage, preservation and disposal. But at some point it touched on digitisation, not a subject we know a lot about. Fortunately, we have a friend that does, so Librarian [Anya](https://mastodon.me.uk/@anyaso) gave [Tom](https://mastodon.me.uk/@derivadow) at [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/) at poke. Which is how Wednesday came to see Librarians Katherine, Susannah and Anya, together with boss 'brarian Bryn and their computational handmaidens Young Robert and Michael, swap Westminster for the glamour of Euston.

It felt quite odd being in a building where none of the lightbulbs were blown, none of the corners filled with rodent traps and all the lifts stopped at all the floors. Not short of money, those Wellcome folks. It was even more strange to sit through a set of technology slides that were all about the people that used the technology and the benefits returned. Rather than an incomprehensible set of acronyms. It's often said that the old digital thing is really more about culture and collaboration than it is about computers, but one rarely sees it in action. Tom has done fine work. Thanks Tom. Thanks Christy. Thanks Alex. Thanks Jamie. Thanks Paul.

## On the registering of interests

Thursday saw a meeting between [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/) [Giles](https://mastodon.me.uk/@gilesdring) and [Stuart](https://mastodon.me.uk/@slowe), House of Commons Registrars James and Thomas and our very own Young Robert and Michael. Open Innovations have been contracted to build a [quick prototype](https://open-innovations.github.io/register-of-members-interests-proto/), which takes a [set of competency questions](https://open-innovations.github.io/register-of-members-interests-proto/competencies/), a [set of model features](https://open-innovations.github.io/register-of-members-interests-proto/features/) and a set of mappings and allows us to evaluate how changes to model features change the number of competency questions the model can answer. It's all really rather nifty.

For now, we're using it to evaluate which of the [competency questions raised in evidence to the Standards Committee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iRsQBRPChMVFitSGBtNJFGNBvFT8XGKQYYqu40zy_OM/edit?usp=sharing) can be answered by the model features outlined in the [House of Commons Register of Members' Interests ruleset](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmcode/1882/188204.htm). But we see no reason why it can't be applied to other things. The competency question, model feature and mappings data is available under the [Open Parliament Licence](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/copyright-parliament/open-parliament-licence/). More importantly, the code is available under an [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), so, if you have a set of competency questions and a model you'd like to test ... [fill your boots](https://github.com/open-innovations/register-of-members-interests-proto/). We're fairly certain we'll be using it for more things.

## Our Jianhan

By this point, our regular reader may well be asking, what's happened to [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu)? Is there no news of our Jianhan? Well, funny you should ask. We'd been hoping he might spend a little time on [three](https://trello.com/c/op5tFv8d/175-replace-hard-coding-of-start-and-concluding-step-ids-in-procedure-parsing-code) [quick](https://trello.com/c/5c2Di4Mz/153-parse-with-step-depth) [tweaks](https://trello.com/c/mTqWZiY9/47-parse-for-plausibility) to our procedure parsing code. But, unfortunately, it was not to be. Our Jianhan instead preparing the ground for our planned new data platform by attempting to export 300 million [triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) from our search and indexing store. 300 million! Not a number to be sniffed at. The poor lad's gonna need a faster Dell. And a bigger telephone.
