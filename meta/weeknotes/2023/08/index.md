# 2023 - Week 8

## Lifting / shifting

If our regular reader has turned up in expectation of the usual procedural [pedantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) content, we fear they're in for something of a disappointment. It's not all the ins and inevitable outs of statutory instrument and treaty procedure round our house. Sometimes, we have to get our heads down and do actual computational things. It may not please our reader. It does not please us. But someone needs to take care of the blasted things.

Late last year - sometime around October we think - Azure started popping up a slightly ominous message. As Microsoft products are wont to do. We were informed - in no uncertain terms - that [support for Ruby 2.7.2 would cease in April](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates/rubysupport/). This made a certain sense. Ruby 2.7.2 being several version numbers before the latest stable release. Hurrah, we thought. Someone in Seattle has given some thought to security vulnerabilities.

We made an appointment with ourselves for the new year, expecting, at worst, a week's worth of updating Ruby, [Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) and associated [Gems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems). Imagine our disappointment when we reconvened, examined the small-print and found our partners were not only deprecating Ruby 2.7.2, but deprecating Ruby in general. Insult was compounded by injury with the less than welcome news that users of Azure who wish to use Ruby could continue to do so but [only via the medium of Docker](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/HowTo/use_ruby_with_container.md#how-to-run-ruby-on-rails-custom-container-on-app-service). Not a situation anyone wants to find themselves in. It's one way to run a "cloud platform", we suppose.

It placed us in the unenviable position of having a handful of Ruby applications and nowhere to run them. Matters were made worse when the syncing scripts from our Google calendars to our beloved [egg timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer) fell over. A tragic event coinciding with [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu)'s absence from the office. Young Robert and Michael searched the length and breadth of Azure for application logs and came back empty handed. Dear reader, you have more chance of searching the hanging files for a deceased and disgraced peer than you have of tracking down application logs on Azure.

Fortunately, [boss 'brarian Bryn](https://twitter.com/brynmrgn) is now in possession of a corporate credit card, which he's handily plugged into [Heroku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku). Since then, [Young Robert](https://mastodon.me.uk/@robertbrook) and [Michael](https://mastodon.me.uk/@fantasticlife) have been manning the GitHub wheel and steering the good ship IDMS into safer waters. So far our [written answer bots](https://written-questions.herokuapp.com/), the [MNIS prodder](https://api.parliament.uk/mnis-prodder) and our beloved egg timer have been migrated. [UK general elections](https://api.parliament.uk/uk-general-elections) to follow shortly. A lot of work for no real reward. Such is computational life.

## Oiling the machinery of gumint

Recent changes to the machinery of government will not have escaped our reader's attention. If you tuned in back in [week 6](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2023/06/#librarians-of-the-week), you'll know that Librarian Emily put in a good enough data wrangling shift to win her a third share in our much coveted Librarian of the Week Award. Departments, positions, incumbencies and people all being subject to her shunting efforts. Unfortunately, the creation of new laying bodies requires the attentions of our Jianhan and our Jianhan was sadly unavailable. So, for a wee while, our crack team of librarians were forced to add a handful of new [work packages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e222) with no laying body. Thankfully, Jianhan has now returned to the fold and that gap has been plugged. We now have our [first statutory instrument laid by the Department for Business and Trade](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/?SearchTerm=&House=&LayingBodyId=iOu7GKad&Procedure=&ParliamentaryProcess=&RecommendedForProcedureChange=&ConcernsRaisedByCommittee=&MotionToStop=&DebateScheduled=&ShowAdvanced=true). Should an SI arrive from the [Department for Energy Security and Net Zero](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-energy-security-and-net-zero/about), the [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology/about) or the [Department for Culture, Media and Sport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-culture-media-and-sport), all three laying bodies wait in the wings.

Our eagle eyed reader may well notice that the laying body drop-downs on both the [SI website](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) and the [treaty tracker](https://treaties.parliament.uk/) grow ever longer, showing current departments alongside departments long dead. Please rest assured. Jianhan has also applied end dates to defunct departments, so at least our computers can differentiate. We'd rather like our users to be able to differentiate too, but, sadly, website serialisation remains outside our control.

## Procedural parsing

As we've attempted to explain at some length, there's little point in making [machine readable procedure maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) if you don't have the code to parse them. Luckily, [we do](https://github.com/ukparliament/procedure-parsing). Equally luckily, we have our Jianhan back. As new features get added to the model, we're keen to keep model, information and machines in sync, so this week Jianhan's also been adding [step depth](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e255) awareness to our parsing code. Which means steps having been [parsed and deemed to be caused to happen, allowed to happen or precluded from happening](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#potential-states-of-a-business-step), all [now appear in procedural order](https://procedures.azurewebsites.net/WorkPackages/5421/stepreport). A change that should make our crack team of librarians' lives much happier. Have a click. See what you think. Top work, as ever, Jianhan.

## Backing gracefully away from parliamentary papers

Back in [week 6](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2023/06/#on-the-mystery-of-parliamentary-papers), we were still struggling with the distinction between papers and parliamentary papers. Off the back of weeknotes, Journal Office Eve got in touch to point out that, whilst [Erskine May defines parliamentary papers quite widely](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/6445/introduction-to-parliamentary-papers-publications-and-records/), the [Parliamentary Papers Act 1840](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/3-4/9/contents) takes a narrower view, being papers published by order of or under the authority of either House. Eve went on to point out that changes to publication practice have led to a schism between legal meaning and common parlance. Not being masochists, these are clearly not waters we wish to wade into and our - possibly naive - desire to separate papers and parliamentary papers has now been abandoned.

Occasionally we get asked why we bother to write weeknotes. This is exactly why we write weeknotes. You don't get these kind of insights from distributing a RAG report. Thanks JO Eve.

## Procedural cartography

Not much news on the procedural cartography front this week. Librarian Jayne and her computational cabin boy Michael continue to plug away at documenting what can happen to a motion and when and why. Once the [cheat sheets](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/motion-cheat-sheets/) are complete and signed off by the usual suspects, they plan to incorporate all they've learned back into map land.

Librarian Jayne has made a small tweak to our [CRaG treaty map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/treaties/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf), where urgent questions in the House of Lords are no longer self-precluding. Which means we can now capture questions in the plural where that happens. Which [it does](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2022-10-26/debates/066EF61C-72FB-450B-84F1-8485E4BA8629/UK-IndiaFreeTradeDeal).

Over in statutory instrument land, Librarian Jayne stumbled across an unexpected motion in the early day baggage area when the [Official Controls (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2023](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/instrument/Lzd3QdY2/) turned up with both a [fatal prayer](https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/60551) and an [accompanying EDM](https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/60552). Unfortunately, the [EDM website](https://edm.parliament.uk/) does not allow associated EDMs to be linked together. An unfortunate omission. In the absence of a link on that side, we wondered if we should add one on ours. We already have steps dealing with fatal motions - obviously - but nothing covering accompanying EDMs. A convention of crack librarians was convened, which came to the conclusion that we can't keep expanding the procedure maps to plaster over cracks in the rest of the website. Always nice when we decide to do nothing.

In other exciting mapping news, Librarians Jayne and [Ayesha](https://mastodon.me.uk/@askalibrarylady) have finally finished checking all the [routes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e164) in our [legislative reform order map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/legislative-reform-orders/legislative-reform-order.pdf). That's 1441 routes which is a hell of a lot of routes. Their efforts were rewarded when they found two routes accidentally plugged into the wrong [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e175). Given our data input workflow involves computational cabin lad Michael reading out 'AB AND to BC NOT' over a wonky Teams line, such an error rate only goes to show that Michael's diction is improving. Or Jayne has learnt to lip read.

## Electioneering

Librarians Anna, Emily and [Phil](https://mastodon.social/@Mognar) continue to plug away at preparations for the next general election. Between now and then, we are, of course, expecting a boundary change. Which means the current 650 constituencies will fade out of existence and 650 new ones will need to be created. Thanks to geographic expert Carl, we now have a list of proposed names for the new constituencies, the region or nation they sit inside and their type - being borough or county. The data has been loaded into a spreadsheet roughly the same shape as the constituency table in MNIS. We remain a trifle confused as what all these attributes might be, where they might be used and even whether they're used. Who knew that clerks have their own IDs and names for constituencies? I mean, it seems unlikely. Most of the attributes in MNIS are nullable, but, before we discount them, Librarian Anna is investigating which ones are populated for current constituencies. And which ones aren't.

One column in the constituencies table was less of a mystery but definitely none of our business. A schools subsidy band is applied on a per constituency basis to calculate subsidies for school trips to Parliament. Colleagues in Engagement and Education have been alerted that - should the boundary change happen as expected - they have 650 new records to update.

Librarian Phil has also been investigating how data captured by Commons librarians in Oli's candidate database was transferred to MNIS. He's managed to uncover a couple of XML files: [one listing winning candidates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukparliament/ontologies/master/meta/relational/mnis/candidates/mnis-members.xml) for the 650 constituencies, [one listing all candidates with vote counts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukparliament/ontologies/master/meta/relational/mnis/candidates/mnis-results.xml). The plan remains to stop using the old candidates database and instead use feeds from [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/). But that relies on a lot of [careful planning](https://trello.com/b/owaHiYDj/mnis-general-elections) and a lot of identifier alignment for people, parties and constituencies. Which is why we're currently drowning in spreadsheets.

## On matters of modelling

Modelling efforts continue to concentrate on specialising the many and varied ways in which papers are [made available](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/making-available/making-available-ontology) to Parliament. Or at least to a House in Parliament. In addition to our lovely [laying model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/laying/laying-ontology), we now also have [depositing](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/depositing/depositing-ontology), [presentation](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/presentation/presentation-ontology) and [reporting](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/reporting/reporting-ontology) stacked up in the pipelines. Lovely stuff.

Librarian organ grinders Jayne and [Claire]()https://twitter.com/tinysprite alongside their computational monkeys, Young Robert and Michael, have also been busying adding comments to our [bill model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/bill/bill-ontology). Which is now complete. Or as complete as we think it needs to be to for our immediate purposes of helping Legislation Office Liam track [legislative consent motions](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/#legislative-consent-motions).

On the subject of which, Tuesday of week 7 saw a most helpful meeting with Parliament and Constitution Centre colleagues [Graeme](https://twitter.com/woodstockjag), [Richard](https://twitter.com/Richard24235966) and [David](https://twitter.com/davidtorrance). Other than double checking we haven't made entry into LCM procedure self-precluding, we don't think we have any changes to make here. Though time will tell.

## Kind hearts / coronets

Librarian Ned has now added [peerage holding](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/peerage/peerage-ontology#d4e112) records to our [peerage database](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/) for everyone who's ever been on the [register](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/house-of-lords-publications/records-of-activities-and-membership/register-of-all-hereditary-peers/) of people eligible for inclusion in a [House of Lords by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-elections_to_the_House_of_Lords). Or HL2 as we call it in these parts. This including everyone whose ever stood for election, lost and subsequently withdrew from the register. Top stuff.

In Lords Spiritual news, Ned, Robert and Michael continue to plug away at modelling Church of England dioceses - England only - and the bishops incumbent in them. Efforts remain concentrated on a set of Google spreadsheets which Ned's been [busy populating](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mT4ece_DPM6TsmFPxP6Q-Ec33qFCwFdl4OqUu8J1Li8/edit?usp=sharing). Unfortunately, it's the best we can manage given Michael still lacks a working computer. This week, Ned dredged up the matter of the [Acts of Union 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800) giving seats in the UK House of Lords to four Church of Ireland bishops, to be rotated between them. Which complicates matters enormously. The seats ended and bottoms were evicted upon disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871. Whether or not we decide to bite into this cherry rather depends on whether we ever hope to describe all seat incumbencies between 1801 and 1870. We think we know what Paul would think.

## Plugging into peerages

On Wednesday afternoon, Young Robert and Michael had a pixel-based meeting with [Shedcode James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) to chat through how we might bring both peerage and standing order data into the open data platform. James has already done some work on a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful change event API for the latter but there's currently no way for a computer to chat to the peerages database. It turns out that boss computational expert Ian is more a fan of push-based systems than pull-based ones. So James is planning to cost the addition of a REST API to peerages and a [message queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) based solution for both. Marvellous!

## And finally ...

Monday of week 8 saw your usual cast of characters meet with procedural colleagues from the Northern Ireland Assembly. For once in real life, rather than pixels. The chat was supposed to cover all matters pertaining to computational procedure but took an early swerve into difficulties emerging from [funding arrangements](https://platformplaybook.xyz/funding) and [commissioning](https://platformplaybook.xyz/identify) setups. A delightful conversation. Well, we enjoyed it anyway. Though we hope we did not bore our guests. Thanks Roisin. Thanks Michael. Thanks Kevin.
