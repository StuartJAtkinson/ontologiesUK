# 2023 - Week 36

Dear friends, we have once again let you down, let our crack team of librarians down and let ourselves down. It has been four weeks without notes. For once, we cannot blame our own tardiness. We've actually been quite busy. Partly with play, mostly with work. Let's start with the work.

## The work

### Back to school

The long, hot summer months passed as long, hot summer months tend to pass. Rest, relaxation and recuperation pebble-dashed with brief moments of boredom and a fleeting desire to re-enter the fray. That said, by the time Sunday evening came around; Songs of Praise, Antiques Roadshow and That's Life had all been enjoyed; packed lunches were packed and schoolbags dragged from the back of cupboards, that existential feeling of dread that tends to accompany back to school weekends set in for all concerned.

As our dear reader knows all too well, our crack team of librarians never let existential dread stand in their way for too long. By the time the Erskine Express had pulled into Westminster Station and our Members had disembarked, Slack channels and Teams calls were already filling up with the chatter of fresh-faced librarians keen to organise some information. If you please.

Back to school Monday is always a busy time in these parts. Whilst Members may submit questions for approval by the Table Offices over [recess](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/time-period/time-period-ontology#d4e269), should those questions [meet Table Office standards](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/question-and-answer/workflows/lords/flow.pdf) they are not considered [tabled](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/tabling/tabling-ontology#d4e94) until the new term starts. Which means our crack team faced a daunting pile of somewhere around 1500 written questions to subject index by nightfall. And then our [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) caught fire.

### Fire in the bilge

For reasons we still do not pretend to understand - we're working on it, we're working on it - at some point on Monday morning, our indexing application - the tool used by our crack team of librarians to subject index, procedurally index and interlink parliamentary material - started to slow down. It should probably be pointed out that it's never been exactly what one might call quick. There's many an occasion on which a librarian has pressed save and had to sit around for five seconds waiting for the computer to get back. Five seconds though, is as naught, compared to five minutes, 15 minutes or - on occasion - the 45 minutes it was taking to save a record on Monday. Given ~1500 written questions to process and a response time closing in on an hour, we'll leave the maths to our dear reader.

No librarian is an island, and our librarians have a service agreement with Hansard to get headings in place before the start of the following day's business. With deadlines in mind, boss 'brarian [Anya](https://mastodon.me.uk/@anyaso) bit the bullet and sent out the "all hands on deck" cry.

### All hands on deck

By some point around midday on Monday, all available hands were indeed on deck. Which only made matters worse. The more people using the system, the slower the system got. "Oh, good lord", wept Anya. "All hands off deck", she cried, face flecked with tears.

On the computational side of the aisle, all the usual fixes were tried, only meeting with very partial success. Things were turned off. And back on again. The web server was upgraded. The memory allocation was upped. The latter course of action appeared to make the most difference, but - as of Friday - we're still seeing response times measured in minutes, not seconds.

By Thursday lunchtime the situation was still looking less than ideal. We can't go on like this, declared Anya, convening an emergency meeting of technical "experts". Forsaking lunch, even [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) managed to drag himself clear of the triplestore wreckage to join us in pixels. Face only slightly sooty, hair only slightly singed.

Even as confirmed [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)ists, the [collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework#Moving_through_domains) from [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework#Complex) to [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework#Chaotic) can be teeth-jarringly terrifying. For now, we're following what can only be described as 'novel practice'. Or act, sense, respond as the good [Mr Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Snowden) might say. After all, when one's house catches fire, one does not stop to make a plan.

Which brings us neatly on to ...

### Librarians of the week

A boss of steely heart, it takes quite a lot for Anya to hand out one of our much coveted Librarian of the Week awards. Not this week. This week, all librarians get a Librarian of the Week certificate and a shiny badge - they're in the post, honest. A list then: [Librarian Anna](https://twitter.com/anna_buck), Librarian Anya, [Librarian Ayesha](https://twitter.com/askalibrarylady), [Librarian Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite), Librarian Deanne, Librarian Emily, Librarian Emma, [Librarian Jayne](https://twitter.com/greytgordon), Librarian Jayshree, Librarian Kirsty, Librarian Jason, Librarian Martin, Librarian Ned, [Librarian Phil](https://twitter.com/philbgorman), Librarian Steve and last - but only alphabetically - Librarian Tim. As hot chocolates were sipped and Monday night bedtime closed in, most of our crack team were still hard at work. Which is going way beyond the call of duty.

Not only this. Given Anya's in an extra generous mood, she's also distributed Librarian of the Week awards to boss computational expert Ian, single-point of success Jianhan - his [second such award in as many weeks](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2023/32/#librarian-of-the-week), computational bodyline bowler [Michael](https://mastodon.me.uk/@fantasticlife), Sadia and Ravi.

I get a Librarian of the Week, you get a Librarian of the Week, we all get a Librarian of the Week. And, by heck, do we deserve it. There's only really Young Robert missing from the list. Mostly because he chose this week, of all weeks, to take a vacation. You picked a fine time to leave us, sunshine.

Before our dear reader gets the impression Library life if all just passing buckets down chains for our Jianhan to throw over smouldering bin fires, actual non-firefighting work has also happened. Though it's a bloody miracle we remember what. Here, then, goes.

### New old search

Whilst the good ship [parliamentary search](https://search.parliament.uk/search) shows every sign of sinking, that's no reason to not give the deckchairs a decent splash of new paint. Work therefore continues on new old parliamentary search, albeit somewhat slower with Anya's attentions understandably elsewhere. Data analyst Raafay has now, well, [analysed the attributes present](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_YDrKM7CFm7nHuCJn8nSMUysvbx_tsrNOuW7Vf22Exs/edit?usp=sharing) for 28 of our 34 content types. Top work Raafay. There's more work we'd like to do to, well, analyse the data, particularly in terms of slicing it by time periods and distribution. A meeting has been pencilled in for next week when Raafay, data scientist Louie and computational dibbly-dobbler Michael hope to spec out what that model might look like.

Elsewhere, designer Graeme continues to churn through object views under the expert tutelage of Librarians Anya and Jayne. At this point, he's probably learned more about parliamentary materials than he ever hoped to know, but he appears to stay cheerful. Frontend developer Jon has also been hard at work turning Graeme's pixels into [functioning code](https://github.com/ukparliament/search-prototype). A process that would be made much easier if Anya had the time to follow up on Raafay's work and fill out our three-dimensional data dictionary. As things stand, fat chance of that.

In more backend news, our Jianhan has made magnificent progress upgrading our antediluvian [Solr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr) instance to something more modern. We're also delighted to - finally - have access to a development environment, so remain hopeful that - at some point in the not too distant future - we may be able to plug Jon's Rails efforts into Jianhan's new Solr instance and the whole thing will [form like Voltron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1IMp9KwNMg&t=96s&ab_channel=WuTangClanVEVO). The sooner we can couple frontend to backend, the sooner we'll be confident we're on the right track. Or aren't. To state the blindingly obvious though, our backend - Solr - is the frontend for the wider search service. So extinguishing the basement fire remains the priority.s

### Procedural cartography updates

Luckily, [data platform mk 3](https://api.parliament.uk/) has not yet caught on fire so we're still able to update [statutory instrument](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) and [treaty tracker](https://treaties.parliament.uk/) data in near real time. Librarian Jayne's hair being largely intact - as the rest of us succumb to self-inflicted baldness - serving as testament to a job well done. Thanks [big guy](https://twitter.com/langsamu).

For this reason, we are pleased, nae delighted, to announce that Librarians Ayesha, Claire and Jayne have now completed redrawing all [41 of our procedure maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) in Visio. 41! Count 'em. This neatly removes our dependency on the installation of Omnigraffle and - by extension - on the possession of Macs. It's also provided a helpful training platform for Jayne to instruct Ayesha and Claire in [the fine art of logical and arithmetic procedure mapping](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/). Such fine work would, in any normal week, merit a Librarian of the Week award. But - as discussed - Ayesha, Claire and Jayne have already received their awards for chipping in with our efforts to pour water over our computational chip fire. And, even in her most generous of moods, Anya is not the type to hand out double Librarian of the Week awards. That would clearly be an extravagance too far on the public purse.

As part of the redrawing work, Librarian Claire has also patched over something of an omission. Whilst we've had a procedural map and accompanying data for [Queens' Consent Motions](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/prerogative-consent/queens-consent/queens-consent.pdf) since some point in 2021 - possibly earlier - we'd never quite got round the doing the same for The King. An omission that [Ben](https://twitter.com/tc1415) pointed out some months back. And an omission that Librarian Claire has [now fixed](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/prerogative-consent/kings-consent/kings-consent.pdf). We know we're occasionally slow, Ben, but we get there eventually.

### Treaty tinkering

At some point over the summer, Librarian Emma was perusing Votes and Proceedings when she came across [a job lot of committee correspondence on the subject of treaties](https://trello.com/c/xE53lmKg/422-correspondence-for-treaties). Should we include such letters on our treaty timelines? being the obvious question to ask. Now, the question of what may and may not form part of a procedure / work package is a vexed one for us. Where a procedure begins and ends being a little too existential for our limited brains. In such cases, we tend to fall back on what we think might be useful. And in this case, we came down on the side of useful.

Procedure maps being data, not code - though again the distinction is an existential one - they are easy to change. So Librarians Ayesha, Claire and Jayne have added new steps to a bunch of [treaty procedure component maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/treaties/#committees), describing committee correspondence, Jayne sweeping along behind and [actualising said steps in all applicable work packages](https://trello.com/c/axjCeRlU/572-treaty-committee-correspondence-data-task). A quick glance down our [timeline for the Australia Free Trade Agreement](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/snzFSs5u/CP-689) will rapidly reveal the results. Being quite a lot of correspondence. The [International Trade Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/367/international-trade-committee/) must get through [Speaker Stamps](https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-information-office/G20.pdf) like our librarians get through tea bags. We will leave the question of usefulness in the hands of our user. Which, in this case, is more than likely to be [Arabella](https://twitter.com/Arabella_Law). Other opinions more than welcome.

### People, places, parties

Stage left, general election preparations continue. We think we're mainly on top of things, what had been something of a scrabble now taking on a [pleasingly Kanban cadence](https://trello.com/b/owaHiYDj/mnis-general-elections). Following tip offs from statistician Carl, our [constituencies spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aL9zZTQiFRawizFtJt_l1wcKGQ0GKLIR5JhJzkxfhbQ/edit?usp=sharing) now comes complete with ONS codes for the proposed new constituencies in [England, Wales](https://trello.com/c/oD9tTpjk/141-add-england-and-wales-ons-codes-to-constituency-spreadsheet) and [Scotland](https://trello.com/c/oD9tTpjk/141-add-england-and-wales-ons-codes-to-constituency-spreadsheet). We eagerly await the release of new identifiers for constituencies in Northern Ireland. Thanks Carl. Top work Librarian Anna.

For reasons that escape us, whilst new identifiers have been minted for all new constituencies in England and Wales - regardless of whether their names or boundaries have changed - the same is not true in Scotland. For new Scottish constituencies where boundaries remain unchanged from their predecessor, the old ONS code is reused. Not particularly neat. Or indeed tidy. This slightly unexpected behaviour has now been [documented in one of our many manuals](https://trello.com/c/H1TowEex/209-document-that-onscodes-are-not-unique-across-sets). I mean, of course it has. We're librarians. We live for manuals. There's still [work to do](https://trello.com/c/P0gbiZ4W/208-test-duplicate-onscode-in-mnis-qa) to check that [MNIS](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/) doesn't choke when presented with two constituencies with the same ONS code. But we don't *think* there's any uniqueness constraint on that field, so we should be safe.

Finally, again for reasons we don't fully comprehend, several hundred ex-Members of the Commons had no end date on their party affiliation. Party affiliations, in our case, pretty much corresponding to [whippings](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/parliamentary-bloc/parliamentary-bloc-ontology#d4e171). Edge cases aside. What one does not want, when analysing whipping data, is several hundred people whipped to parties when those people haven't been in Parliament for the best part of a decade. Slowly, patiently, methodically, Librarian Anna has spent a large part of the summer working through them and all records are now fixed. Splendid stuff, Anna.

### Rush data updated

In more green carpet / Librarian Anna related news, she's also spent a good part of her summer squinting at [Professor Rush](https://psaparliaments.org/tag/michael-rush/)'s index cards, attempting to decipher his handwriting and adding the results to our [Rush database](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/). Following on from a general election, we create skeleton records - name, constituency, party - for every new Member. Adding the prof's special sauce of educational background, employment background, trade union associations and whatnot taking considerably longer. Thanks to Librarian Anna, that work is now done. At least until the next general election. Splendid.

### Wrangling end reasons

Librarian Emily has spent a large part of her summer trying to wrap her head around "end reasons". Or [why a Member might leave the House of Commons](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/house-membership/end-reasons/). Following much to-ing and a deal of fro-ing, that work has now been signed off by researcher Neil. And a fine bit of work it is too. Now we have a definitive list, it only remains to [tidy the Commons data in MNIS](https://trello.com/c/9jFI1Ykr/181-tidy-commons-end-reasons) and [let the red carpet contingent know our conclusions](https://trello.com/c/vaGfwj8G/185-share-proposed-list-of-end-reasons-with-the-lords-for-their-feedback). Thanks for your patience, Neil. Top work Emily. 

### Kind hearts / coronets

Whilst team:Anya may be based in the House of Commons Library, we are nothing if not bicameral. As indeed are many of our Members. The Rush database is centred on Members of the House of Commons, but it also contains [records for said Members receiving peerages](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/members/5965). Since Young Robert kindly introduced us all to [querying Postgres directly on Heroku](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2023/24/#top-tips---heroku-related), Librarian Anna has been able to put together [a query returning all Rush Members with a peerage record alongside the type, degree and title of that peerage](https://data.heroku.com/dataclips/yusfjymhximxothjczgbzmfeyktu). Librarian Ned has taken that query and added a whole bunch of additional 'subsequent' holders of peerages to our [Beamish database](https://peerages.historyofparliamentonline.org/), which means that every person in Rush with a peerage holding in the Peerages field is now also in Beamish. A librarian's job never being done until the identifiers are aligned, Ned has also added the newly created Beamish IDs to both Rush and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P10849). Wonderful librarianship.

### Facts / figures

Work also continues on refactoring, reformatting and generally improving our [Parliamentary Facts and Figures series](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/parliament-facts-and-figures/), this week seeing a new publication by Librarian Jayne on the subject of [Sittings of the House of Commons over 24 hours since 1901](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06439/). Lovely stuff.

### A small improvement to the egg timer

Thanks to the diligent efforts of Librarian Ned, our [beloved egg timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer) came equipped from the start with a comprehensive set of dates for [parliamentary periods back to 1801](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer/parliament-periods). The same was not true of our session date data, which only extended back to the birth of the statutory instrument service in 2017. Contact was made with our friends at [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/), who kindly sent through a spreadsheet of session dates, again back to 1801. Librarian Jayne [added those dates to our own spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3AnQebAO5ug-Pc_0qDq9KkyZiy0dRhJMvm0lRRJOXk/edit?usp=sharing) and gentleman-amateur Michael [uploaded them to the egg timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer/sessions).

The story did not end there, however. In the course of compiling and correcting yet another PFF - this one on the number of sitting days per session - Jayne discovered an error or two in TNA data, swearing in days not always having been been counted. The same errors appear to also crop up over in Wikidataland. Again, our spreadsheet was updated, the egg timer data refreshed and both TNA and Wikidata folks have been notified. Or will have been by the time you read this.

### On orders being standing

Way back in week 33, it was as lovely as ever to see [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) who popped round our gaff for a [standing orders](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontologys) related chinwag. Given rumours of the House of Commons contemplating the publication of a new set of standing orders to cover hybrid business, we had thought there was work remaining to take orders from a [revision set](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontology#d4e137) in one [business extent](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/standing-order/standing-order-ontology#d4e126) and splice them into a revision set in another business extent. Taking to a whiteboard, two possible approaches were outlined. And promptly dismissed as all too complicated. Given a hybrid only publication may well never happen and given that, if it did, such "splicing" would be a once and once only job, writing a query or two seems quicker and cheaper than building a management interface. We think there's still a little work to do to tidy bits and bobs of the workflow, but it feels like we're getting closer every week. More news soon, we hope.

## And the play









### Wuthering bytes

Boss librarian Anya and her tame computational "experts" Young Robert and Michael took a trip up north to call in at the [Wuthering Bytes festival](https://wutheringbytes.com/). And splendid it was too, talks ranging from the [history of telephone exchange buildings](https://twitter.com/tele_exchange) to [rescuing the work of Daphne Oram from defunct Archimedes disks](https://www.gold.ac.uk/ems/oram/) to [designing your own computer chips](https://zerotoasiccourse.com/). On the subject of which, Michael was forced to enquire of [Matt](https://chaos.social/@matthewvenn) whether our procedure maps could be encoded on chips, to which the answer was - excitingly - "[possibly!](https://chaos.social/@matthewvenn/110955918452547057)" Imagine that. Parliamentary procedure but at chip level. Wow. We'd be the fastest democracy in the West.

Our intrepid explorers were supposed to be accommodated at a hotel just outside Hebden Bridge, which - being notorious hipsters - would have suited them perfectly. Unfortunately, the hotel went bankrupt shortly before the conference, so they ended up in Bradford. Which is a very different place. To help them settle in, [Tom](https://twitter.com/thomasforth) was kind enough to brave the [West Yorkshire Cycle Superhighway](https://www.cyclecityconnect.co.uk/our-routes/bradford-leeds-cycle-superhighway/) for a bedtime pint or two. Lovely to see you as ever, Tom. On the subject of people it was lovely to see, waves also to [Bill](https://someone.elses.computer/@billt), [James](https://twitter.com/jimshep), [Paul](https://twitter.com/paulcconnell) and [Giles](https://mastodon.me.uk/@gilesdring). We hope to be back next year.

### We had a reunion

And finally, those of us that have met Michael would probably be loath to describe him as a "reunion" type of guy. Not one for nostalgia, in any form, he's often been described - mostly by himself -  as an "avatar of aheadness". It may surprise people to learn then, that over a pint or two with Anya and [Jake](https://twitter.com/carboia), he came to the conclusion that what the [Parliamentary Computational Section Class of 2019](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1697314239965241587) needed was a reunion. And so a reunion was organised.

Not having two ha'pennies to rub together, the decision was taken to hire the salubrious Garden Room at the [Crown and Cushion public house](http://www.thecrownandcushion-london.foodanddrinksites.co.uk/), who've never been known to evict a paying clientele. Sadly, [Usman](https://twitter.com/_UsmanAfzal) couldn't make it, finding himself on the receiving end of a nasty bout of 'rona a couple of days before curtains up. We hope you're well on the road to recovery now, Usman. Along for the ride were Librarians Anya and Jayne; residential computational "experts" Young Robert, Jianhan and Michael; House of Lords Ben; and much-missed former colleagues [Bex](https://twitter.com/rklappleyard), Jake, James, [Jamie](https://twitter.com/oddtype), [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattrayner), [Matthieu](https://twitter.com/cognithive), Mike, Samu and Wojciech. Enough to bring a tear to the hardest of hearts. Sighs.
