# 2021 - Week 28

The [last](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2021/25/) [couple](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2021/26/) of weeks turned out to be thinking weeks. And, as we tend to think with our mouths open, notes for those weeks tended toward the verbose. This week we abandoned thinking for doing and so, instead of having to wade through our mindless prattle, we present yo a bullet point list:

* The [logical](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/meta/design-notes/with-step-types/#logic-steps), [arithmetical](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/meta/design-notes/with-step-types/#arithmetic-steps) and indeed [componentised](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/tree/master/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/logic-gates/components) map of the treaty procedure as set out by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 sections [20](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/section/20#section-20), [21](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/section/21#section-21) and [22](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/section/22#section-22) is now [complete](https://trello.com/c/bCq9iuBR/131-remap-treaties). [Hallelujah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAk6Euat-6A). [Look at it](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/logic-gates/crag-treaties.pdf). [Click on it](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/logic-gates/crag-treaties.pdf) and [look at it](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/logic-gates/crag-treaties.pdf). It's beautiful.

* Our [Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) has patched his way around a data error that had been haunting the [Search and Indexing](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/meta/data-flow/search-indexing/data-flow.pdf) triple store since sometime in 2012. One type of identifier for Members was not being consistently mapped to another type of identifier for Members, leading to some contributions not always acknowledging their contributor. Top work Jianhan.

* Jianhan has also [dipped a hand into developments](https://trello.com/c/eZ5aP0Ts/23-create-work-packageable-thing-with-more-than-one-work-package-in-staging-triple-store) on the [data platform](https://api.parliament.uk/), creating test data for our first [work packageable thing](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e233) with more than one [work package](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e222). Whilst also removing a stray [inverse functional](https://www.w3.org/wiki/InverseFunctionalProperty) property and thereby avoiding a rather nasty [inference explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion). The presence of a work packageable thing with more than one offspring to test against should make life much easier for our colleagues in Software Engineering.

* Michael has [added](https://trello.com/c/ALIjQdvs/145-add-code-to-parse-routes-from-signpost-steps) yet more [code](https://api.parliament.uk/procedures/meta/comments) to our [procedure parser](https://api.parliament.uk/procedures/work-packages/9), this time to deal with our delightful new [signpost steps](https://api.parliament.uk/procedures/comments/signpost_step.rb.html). Although, as young Robert has been on vacation, it is yet to receive the all important second pair of eyes. At which point it will probably get rewritten.

* Our live SI [maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#maps) and data saw their first [small change](https://trello.com/c/iqa98eHd/395-slsc-oral-evidence) in what feels like many months, as a new step to capture oral evidence sessions conducted by the [Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/255/secondary-legislation-scrutiny-committee/) was inserted. Within minutes, Librarian Jayne had reindexed the [pair](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/vG7FkkPP/SI-202031) of [instruments](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/st4lp11z/SI-2021) where this step was pertinent. Flipping a jaunty salute in her direction, we hope, as ever, that JO Jane is pleased with our alacrity.

* In the absence of young Robert, [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and Michael turned their attentions to [relationifying](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/relational/) all things [election related](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/election/election-ontology.html). It quickly became apparent that their knowledge of UK geographies in general and constituency boundary changes in particular were not quite up to the job. We already miss [Oli](https://twitter.com/olihawkins). A cry for help on how and why the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) allocates constituency IDs has been dispatched to [Andy](https://twitter.com/mr_dudders). We wait and hope.
