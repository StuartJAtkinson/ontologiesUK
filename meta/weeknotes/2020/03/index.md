# 2020 - Week 3

The week started in high excitement. [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) had mistakenly and somewhat drunkenly volunteered to give a talk at the [Study of Parliament Group](http://www.studyofparliament.org.uk/) conference in Oxford. And for some reason their offer had been taken up. Armed with the conceit that if [Erskine May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_May) had had a computer he may not have written a book and some lovely slides courtesy of Robert, they [took to the stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgEw_YtfxYM). They'd like to thank [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) for offering a friendly front row face which Michael chose to not look past. It seemed to go quite well. But they were perhaps too nervous to remember.

On the Monday, librarian Jayne and Michael had the first of many conversations about explicit modelling of [motions to consider](https://trello.com/c/umhb7F8N/50-explicit-modelling-of-motions-to-consider). Current Statutory Instrument procedure maps only have a committee debate step which doesn't cope at all well with the edge case of a committee having a debate and then deciding they have in fact not considered. Which is a thing that's been known to happen. So we need to do a better job with consideration motions. And motions in general.

On Tuesday, Robert and Michael poured over the code for the [Standing Order application](http://standing-orders.herokuapp.com/) they've hacked together. There was a problem with the numbering of fragments which lead to fragment number 10 overwriting fragment number 1 and fragment number 20 overwriting fragment number 2 and etc. Investigations proved it was not, for once, a problem with their code, but a problem with the [source data](https://parlrulesdata.org/). They got in touch with the research group in Oxford who set out to fix it.

Librarian Jayne ran the usual meeting to talk through some issues in the procedure maps. There was more talk of motions. And the explicit modelling thereof. We feel explicit motion modelling is one that will run and run.
