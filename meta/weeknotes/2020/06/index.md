# 2020 - Week 6

On Tuesday, Robert and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) met Anna Murphy from the House of Lords Journal Office. We had hoped for Anna to represent the Lords at our meeting last week with Commons [Martyn](https://twitter.com/martynpatrick). But unfortunately a last minute calendar glitch prevented Anna from joining us. So we rescheduled, only to find our whiteboard room is now an office. Crouching inconspicuously behind a desk, Robert and Michael managed to sketch on one of our many verboten whiteboards. Though they did wipe it clean. Very clean.

The upshot of the meeting was that [House of Lords Public Standing Orders](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/house-of-lords-publications/rules-and-guides-for-business/the-standing-orders-of-the-house-of-lords-relating-to-public-business/) are not so different from [those in the House of Commons](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201919/cmstords/341/toc.html) in terms of how they come into being, are amended, lapse or revoked. Which is all we need to describe them on a model level. We're hoping to work with [Rad](https://radoslawzubek.com/) and his team to create a dataset for Lords Public SOs in the [same format as the data generated for Commons Public SOs](https://parlrulesdata.org/). And we'd like to work in titles and section headings whilst we're on the job. Conversations with [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) pointed to 1954 as a good place to start, as a whole bunch of changes happened that year following a report by the Procedure Committee in 1953. David has helpfully sent through scans of the subsequent 1954 Procedure Committee report. Thanks as ever David.

Librarians Jayne and [Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite) and computational expert Michael spent a chunk of Thursday raising a ticket to [add time bound routes](https://trello.com/c/CDGB80DD/57-time-bound-routes) to our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html). This has been a long term item on our backlog / wishlist. It has snuck up the stack because we'd like to [add specific select committees](https://trello.com/c/NpMa1uRA/34-treaties-explicit-commons-select-committees) to our [treaty procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf) and select committees change in line with machinery of government changes. More generally, procedures are also subject to change as the things that [inform them](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/informing/informing.pdf) - legislation, resolutions, Standing Orders, new interpretations of precedent and, in the House of Commons, Speaker Rulings - change. Michael tends to wave his hands and shout about [pace layering](https://flickr.com/photos/psd/29369132582) at this point. We need to be able to reflect these changes in our procedure maps. So fingers crossed we're able to soon.
