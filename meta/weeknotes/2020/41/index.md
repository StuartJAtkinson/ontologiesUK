# 2020 - Week 41

So then, another week down. And another week closer to the end of the Now Times. Perhaps. It has not, in all honesty, been our most productive of weeks. [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_)_ was mostly mired in meetings and other assorted administrivia. And Librarians Anya, Jayne and [Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite), together with dabbling computational dilettante [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) spent two whole days glued to headsets in their latest efforts at...

## ...expanding the family

In a little under a month they've managed to narrow down the candidate field from 128 to 9 to 4 to 1. And late on Friday they got news that the 1 had accepted. At least verbally. We look forward to welcoming a new librarian shortly. Or as shortly as security clearances might allow.

## Procedure mapping

If you've been following along, you'll know that our [Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) has made excellent progress on the implementation of [procedural time bound routes](https://trello.com/c/CDGB80DD/57-time-bound-routes). These allow us to state that a [route](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e164) through a procedure was only valid after a certain date or only valid before a certain date. So we can retain the fact that, prior to the 24th April 2020, the laying of a treaty in the House of Lords allowed the treaty to be allocated to the [EU External Affairs Sub-Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/336/eu-external-affairs-subcommittee/). But, from the 24th April, this was no longer true. Because the websites compress a rather complicated interwingled graph into a list, there is little direct benefit at this point to end users. That said, our [work package visualisations are now somewhat less noisy](https://procedures.azurewebsites.net/WorkPackages/3167/graph) and no longer show steps living at the end of deprecated routes. And those visualisations are what our dedicated team of librarians use to check their own work and the work of Parliament. The less noise we present, the easier the checking and the better the checks. So eventually everyone benefits from better data. Not least our users.

The work for this week was liaising with colleagues in Software Engineering to check that none of our changes had inadvertently broken their websites. That testing happened Monday and we're happy to report our changes broke nothing. Our Jianhan has now pushed ontology changes and orchestration tweaks to live, the time bound routes card has moved firmly to the done pile and another Slack channel has been closed. Top work Jianhan.

In other testing news, our attempts to [add a new procedure](https://trello.com/c/TMHt6dSy/156-introducing-other-procedures) did not go so well. Librarian Jayne created a new test procedure and two associated [work packages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e259) in the staging environment of the data platform. On Wednesday colleagues in Software Engineering tested the changes in their test environment but the new procedure did not appear in the dropdown and the two test work packages did not display any associated work. Software Engineering continue to investigate. Jayne and Jianhan continue to provide assistance.

Continuing our work with [Rad](https://radoslawzubek.com/), [Tom](https://twitter.com/tomgfleming) and other assorted friends in Oxford, Jayne has now [added Standing Order citation blobs](https://trello.com/c/VJUF5xkl/161-adding-standing-order-citation-blobs-on-procedures) to all [our procedure maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#maps). Or at least the ones for which we have data. If any clerkly colleagues find themselves with a spare hour on their hands, they might want to consider brewing up a fresh pot of tea and checking her work. This in particular should your name be [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly), Paul, [Martyn](https://twitter.com/martynpatrick), JO Jayne, [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattKorris) or Luanne.

Jayne and Michael spent a pleasant few hours back in the world of the [treaty procedure map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf). What had been a set of bubbles relating to a generic House of Commons Select Committee is now [an explicit name check for the International Trade Committee](https://trello.com/c/NpMa1uRA/34-al-treaties-explicit-commons-select-committees). Since a treaty might, in theory, be scrutinised by any Commons Select Committee with an interest, and because there are quite a lot of Commons Select Committees, they've decided that they'll be reactive rather than proactive and only add new Select Committees as they pick up treaties and report. Which should also help to salvage what little is left of their eyesight. The [ITC](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/367/international-trade-committee) was excepted from this firm rule of thumb because we know they're planning to scrutinise the [UK Japan Trade Deal](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-japan-agree-historic-free-trade-agreement). And it seemed worth getting ahead of the game for once.

Following conversations with [Arabella](https://twitter.com/Arabella_Law) and [Ellie](https://twitter.com/ellie_hourigan), Jayne and Michael have also added new steps for [committees to recommend that scrutiny period A be extended](https://trello.com/c/KEDvQFMr/201-treaty-committee-recommendations-that-treaty-period-a-be-extended). This for both the International Trade Committee and the [Joint Committee on Human Rights](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/93/human-rights-joint-committee/membership/).

In final treaty procedure news, Jayne and Michael have also made a start on adding [motions calling on the government to extend period A](https://trello.com/c/ftcelET1/191-treaty-procedure-commons-motion-to-extend-period-a) to the Commons' side of the map. Since a similar motion was already mapped on the Lords' side of the fence, this was mostly a case of lifting and shifting from the red corner to the green. Made slightly more difficult by Michael's computer no longer being capable of drawing pictures. So Jayne did all the work and most of the swearing and Michael chipped in with encouraging noises. Which is not nothing.

## Your weekly egg timer update

Robert and Michael had planned to add a new calculation for those oddity SIs where the egg continues to cook only when both Houses are not adjourned for more than four days. But the best laid plans of men - and mouses - oft come to naught. And that was the case this week.

Our only real [egg timer](http://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) news is rather more exciting. We can now report that, on every occasion on which it has been called into action, the egg timer has returned dates in agreement with those generated by clerks applying the more traditional approach of calendar and abacus. In fairness it has only been called into action twice which can not reasonably be described as an extensive field trial.

Because we often have call to peruse [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/) and because we often work with little screens and because we frequently have to view source to find anchors to link to, Robert has been busy making a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) app that re-renders legislation in a more useful format. The definition of useful here being, 'to us'. This for instance is the [Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010](https://agile-tonsil.glitch.me/ukpga/2010/25). And this is the now infamous [Section 7 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946](https://agile-tonsil.glitch.me/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7). Without which Robert and Michael might have had a summer. You can of course use it to render any piece of legislation. Just take the path from the legislation.gov.uk URI, append it to [https://agile-tonsil.glitch.me/](https://agile-tonsil.glitch.me/) and Bob's your uncle. We do feel this could be useful to a great many people outside our immediate circle. Particularly perhaps for constitutional lawyers on a toilet break. Which is surely an untapped market opportunity.

## Exploring search

Last week, Jianhan and Robert had been exploring how we might use a Bing based search, piped into an [Open Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch) interface to [improve the findability of content](https://trello.com/c/YmWfrg7V/189-library-search) from our [three](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/) [research](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/) [services](https://post.parliament.uk/). Filtering by publisher and content type had been implemented. But then we hit a snag. One requirement was for chronological listing of results by update date. But Bing is not being fed enough information to determine this. Robert met Lina to discuss but the chronological part proved non-negotiable. So for now this work is parked. Though we hope to return one day.
