# 2020 - Week 5

[Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) kicked off his week with an unexpected computational triumph. A Word macro used by committee teams to build photo books of committee Members had gone awry. Michael popped by the Public Bill Office on a mission from [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) to investigate. But ended up accidentally fixing it. Which surprised everyone. Not least Michael.

Wednesday saw librarian Jayne convene the usual meeting on procedure modelling with Claire and Michael. Assorted cards were moved around the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HRIwjNQD/parliament-procedure) and some new tasks prioritised.

Next up was a meeting with [Martyn](https://twitter.com/martynpatrick), librarian Jayne, Robert and Michael to sketch around how [Standing Orders](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/standing-orders/) come into being, how they're modified over time and how they pass out of existence. Mostly they chatted about words to differentiate between SOs that are lapsed or revoked and SOs that are still standing but might be in effect or not currently in effect. There are still words missing here but our understanding of SOs is much improved. Thanks as ever Martyn.

On Thursday librarians Jayne and Anya and computational experts Robert and Michael were joined by [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) to continue their journey through [public bill procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/bills/public-bill.pdf). Unfortunately a last minute upheaval prevented [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattKorris) from joining but we hope to see him soon. Having dealt with commitment motions, non-commitment motions and change of commitment motions they moved on to amendments and the consideration thereof. More whiteboards were filled with tablings and groupings and movings and puttings. None of it felt quite as complicated as they'd envisaged. Which probably means they've misunderstood something. The results await decantation into the public bill flowchart. When that happens, they'll be sent round for the usual comments.

Librarian Jayne and Michael then spent some time poring over Journal Office Jane's feedback on their [delegated legislation to procedure map](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/legislation/delegated-legislation/delegated-legislation.pdf). Improvements were made and Jane pronounced herself happy. Everyone's understanding of [Church of England measures](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/church-of-england-measures/) still being somewhat sketchy. There are gaps to be filled here.
