# 2020 - Week 38

## Expanding the family

As part of the Preparation in our search for a new librarian, [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_), Jayne, [Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite) and visiting printer fixer [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) kicked off Monday morning drafting interview questions. And prompts. And checklists. Then re-drafting them. We now have four questions, numerous prompts and a surplus of things to tick. Interviews to follow shortly.

## Procedure mapping

Last week, [our Jianhan](https://twitter.com/jianhanzhu) updated our [procedure visualisations](https://procedures.azurewebsites.net/Procedures/6/graph) to take account of his recent implementation of [time bound routes](https://trello.com/c/CDGB80DD/57-time-bound-routes). That bit was relatively easy. The only timings he needed to take account of were the [route](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e164) start date, the route end date and some notion of "now". This week he ploughed on into the somewhat more complicated arena of [work package visualisations](https://procedures.azurewebsites.net/WorkPackages/3167/graph). Which need to take account not only of dates on routes but also the [actualisation](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e382) dates on the [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e175) they connect to. Taking his clues from the pseudocode written the week before with Anya, Jayne and Michael, he made a test implementation which Jayne did indeed half test. Which kicked off a whole other conversation about whether and how to show steps actualised with a date in the future, what to do with any routes originating from such a step and what to do about any steps such routes connect to. The decision was taken that steps with actualisation dates in the past should still be shown, but any routes and subsequent steps should not. A somewhat sleepy Michael attempted to [rewrite the pseudocode](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/meta/parsing/) to take account of this, with Jayne whispering typing instructions down the telephone.

Some time before we all got locked in, we'd been attempting to map a [generic motion model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/meta/motions/motion.pdf) for reuse across procedures. In recent weeks Jayne and Michael have been exercising slightly faded memories and attempting to draw up what they half remembered they had half learned. But six months is a long time and six months in lockdown is pretty much a prison sentence. So this week they rolled out the big guns to sense check their scribblings. On Tuesday, Jayne and Michael welcomed [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) to Zoom. And on Thursday Anya, Jayne and Michael entertained and were entertained by Mr Evans. Several things became clearer. Not least that our drawing of moved to amendment consideration to proposed to question put had gotten amendment consideration and proposed in the wrong order. We found out that even if a fatal amendment is agreed to, the question is still put on the motion. And that neither David not Paul cared too much about the "it's only a debate if more than two people speak" rule. And that if only two people speak, the Journal still occasionally calls it a debate if the participants rattle on for long enough. News of which should please [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattKorris). They also found out that, whilst the Lords does have the concept of fatal and non-fatal amendments, the Commons does not. Making it more than possible that our currently anticipated split might not be necessary if all the outcomes of the amendment flow back to the same places anyway. Finally, they were reassured to learn that, whilst in theory amendments can be amended to infinity, in practice the stack is only two levels deep. Which gives them a lot less bubbles and lines to draw. Their model being not very suited to recursion at this point in time. What was learnt still needs to be drawn. Fingers crossed for next week.

Jayne and Michael made a few tiny changes to [procedure maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#maps) and data. A new route was added to everyone's favourite [made affirmative procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/made-affirmative.pdf) to allow [procedure to conclude upon revocation](https://trello.com/c/c5w9J688/180-made-affirmative-procedure-revoked-to-concluded-route-needed). And the tabling of motions in both negative procedures now merely [allow, rather than cause, EVEL consideration](https://trello.com/c/w4eU9QsE/172-negative-procedures-in-the-commons-wrong-type-of-route-to-evel).

Anya, Jayne, Claire and Michael met Wednesday for another of their canters through the [procedure Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HRIwjNQD/parliament-procedure). Michael had wondered out loud if we should be [using ID based URIs to link to legislation.gov.uk](https://trello.com/c/zNHfuUMf/168-should-we-be-using-leggov-id-urls). And [Catherine](https://twitter.com/CathTabone) had [replied within minutes](https://twitter.com/CathTabone/status/1305844888391634946) that he'd used [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) incorrectly and that he's probably misunderstood what the ID URIs are for. But very patiently and politely. Thanks Catherine. Assembled librarians agreed with Catherine, and it was decided doing nothing would be the best course of action.

## Your weekly egg timer update

If you've been following along, you'll know that, in recent weeks, the only visible bit of Michael has been his bottom. As he continued to fall headlong into the rabbit hole that is the definition of sitting days. This week David got back to confirm Journal Office Jane's position that a sitting day extending over two days would only count for one day on the scrutiny clock. A position that was almost immediately quibbled with by Daniel. The question around virtual sitting days hit a new impasse when Mr Greenberg declared that he would not like to say, if a House declared a virtual sitting day to be not a sitting day, how the courts might interpret that in the context of scrutiny periods. All of which lead Michael to write [probably the oddest set of comments he's ever committed to code](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/lib/monkey_patching/date.rb#L141).

Michael has now rewritten the [monkey patched date class](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/lib/monkey_patching/date.rb) to match current understanding to the extent that anything is currently understood. The [egg timer application](http://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) has been placed into maintenance mode because nothing works until the [assorted flavours of calculation](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/tree/master/app/controllers/calculations) are updated to match the new model. That said, our Robert returns from vacation next week. So we should have something back up and running shortly.

## All about the collaboration 

For reasons slightly outside their understanding, [Adam](https://twitter.com/AdamWyner) has invited Anya and Michael to give a talk at a [rules as code](https://govinsider.asia/inclusive-gov/four-things-you-should-know-about-rules-as-code/) event next week. In preparation, Michael battled against a quite furious hangover to stitch together some slides and speaker notes. And the ever helpful Jayne leant a hand by [adding Standing Order and legislation citations to our treaty map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf). Which still need checking by someone more expert than us. It's probable that [Alex](https://twitter.com/AlexanderHorne1) will be in receipt of an email next week.

Anya, Robert, [Oli](https://twitter.com/olihawkins) and Michael joined Bryn for a session sketching out House of Commons Library services, both external and internal. Which emerged as [a Wardley map](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1306607040270397448). Or a Wardley map-ish. The [man himself](https://twitter.com/swardley) describing it as [more of a graph than a map](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1306636885700358146). Our only excuse is it's harder to do this stuff on post-its than whiteboards. And we've wrecked so many whiteboards we've been banned.
 
## Lifelong learning

Librarians Anya, Jayne, Claire and [Liz](https://twitter.com/greensideknits) and computational dilettante Michael popped along to their second Lords procedural seminar on Friday. This time delivered by Mr Beasley and dedicated to the subject of House membership. Which, at first glance, you might think you'd struggle to fill an hour but could in fact probably fill a week. The talk was both informative and entertaining. Thanks Nick.
