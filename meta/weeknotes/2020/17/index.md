# 2020 - Week 17

As the black hole of the Corvid virus envelopes us all and we cross the event horizon of week 4, time has dilated to the point where Monday was now months ago. The past, as they say, is a different country. And so is Monday. Nevertheless, we shall attempt to reconstruct what we can from fragmented memories and haunted dreamscapes.

What we definitely remember from Monday was a call with assorted [LDAPP](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/projects/drafting-tool) interested folks around serialising the [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/) document model into HTML. Mark and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) took to another glitchy phone call to represent UK Parliament interests. LDAPP is an end to end legislation drafting, amendment and publishing application built as a partnership with the two Houses of the UK Parliament, the [Scottish Parliament](https://www.parliament.scot/), the [Office of the Parliamentary Counsel](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-parliamentary-counsel/about), the [Scottish Governmentâ€™s Parliamentary Counsel Office](https://www.gov.scot/about/how-government-is-run/directorates/parliamentary-counsel-office/), and [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/). Of those, the Scottish Government, TNA and our own dear Parliament all have a requirement for publishing HTML. Albeit with a few subtle variations. As luck would have it, TNA have already started tinkering with [XLST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) to transform AkN native XML to browser friendly HTML5. With a dash of [RDFa Lite](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/) for good measure. With the kind permission of [Catherine](https://twitter.com/CathTabone), the [slides for the meeting are available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CV9tcQcbeiVktufq5If3FL-xfoXjxbRBfOG7iFFa-Fc/edit). We anticipate that the AkN model will evolve as all things do, so three different organisations working with three different transforms feels like it has the potential for some amount of wheel reinvention. A vague plan for future collaboration was hatched. More conversations to follow.

Also on Monday, Robert and Michael took out their tiny chisels and continued on their mission to cautiously carve constructive comments into TextMate and [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)). Last week, [Arabella](https://twitter.com/Arabella_Law) pointed out their treaty model had bitten off more than it could reasonably chew. So they've paired it back and stripped out anything pertaining to the cognitive minefield  of "in forceness". The [new treaty model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/treaty/treaty-ontology.html) has been [passed back to Arabella](https://trello.com/c/bsrYW8AR/106-complete-treaty-ontology-rewrite) for what they hope will be approval. In the meantime, Michael has added the revised model to our [interface ontology](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/interface/interface.html) which continues to gobble up our [fag-packety models](http://smethur.st/posts/176135865) and regurgitate them as a [Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld](https://api.parliament.uk/webvowl/#opts=sidebar=0;doc=0;mode_compact=true;mode_colorExt=false;#iri=https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/interface/interface.ttl).

Additional [comment carving](https://trello.com/c/fHL7DD9Q/103-comment-blitz-interface-classes) carried on throughout the week, with Robert and Michael poking around at the somewhat boring [formal body affiliation model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/formal-body-affiliation/formal-body-affiliation-ontology.html). A new version of which is now published. With 23 models down and 29 to go it's ponderous progress, but they operate on the principle that nothing is ever quite finished. And what's time these days?

Wednesday saw Librarian Jayne and Michael take to Onmigraffle and telephones to make a first stab at handing [Statutory Instrument revocation](https://trello.com/c/KWbc8Etq/75-revoked-sis-committee-consideration) and everything that falls out of that. They now have play pen versions of the [made negative](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/sis/play-pen/made-negative.pdf), [made affirmative](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/sis/play-pen/made-affirmative.pdf) and [draft negative](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/sis/play-pen/draft-negative.pdf) procedures, to which revocation steps and associated routes have been added. Draft affirmative being so similar to draft negative - at least in this sense - they decided to leave that one parked for the time being. The call proceded, as these calls often do, with clusters of confusion about why they'd done something in the past that they couldn't get their heads round now. And promptly dismantling past efforts, only to remember ten minutes later why the thing they'd done in the past was exactly the right thing to have done. They need to learn to trust their younger selves a little more and adopt [Chesterton's approach to fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence) that they themselves put up. All three procedure maps have now headed off in search of the approval of Journal Office Jane. So long as she's happy, changes to both the proper maps and the data should follow shortly.

Thursday saw the first procedural librarian discussion of locked down lives. Brarians [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_), Jayne and [Claire](https://twitter.com/tinysprite) together with computation expert Michael made the most of their newly acquired telephone conferencing skills. Much [Trello gardening](https://trello.com/b/HRIwjNQD/parliament-procedure) took place as weeds were weeded, beds were mulched and heads were cleared.
