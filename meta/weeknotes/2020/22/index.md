# 2020 - Week 22

Whilst last week seemed to fly by in a blur of action and unprecedented productivity, this week... did not. Maybe we can blame the Bank "Holiday" for interrupting our flow. Or maybe the weather made gardens, allotments and rum-based cocktails more appealing than shuffling pixels in and out of GitHub. We did try to get our heads down, but no one was really feeling it. Better luck next week one hopes.

## Procedure mapping

After several weeks of email tennis with Mr Evans, Librarian Jayne and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) finally handed in homework that was not destined for the waste paper basket. Friday morning saw their [general purpose decision map](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/meta/decisions/decisions.pdf) met with a cry of, "By Jove, I think you've got it." Politely leaving out the word finally. They hope to roll out [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) and Paul's approved wording changes shortly. Thanks both.

Friday morning was supposed to provide a first opportunity to take a stab at the [super affirmative procedure](https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/collections/AAS0LGpw/super-affirmative-procedure). Or at least that's what calendars said. But confusion reigned and, following a five minute chat, both Librarian Jayne and Michael decided it was all too hard for a sunny Friday morning. So instead they turned their attentions back to the [composite draft procedure](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5622/composite-procedure/) first made famous by the [Census Act 1920](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/10-11/41/contents). Composite procedures combine negative and affirmative elements in some parliamentary chimera that brings fear into the hearts of both librarians and computational experts. The Census SI procedure had been the subject of some rough sketching last week but improvements were sought. As improvements always are. This year, the Commons half of the negative half of the procedure saw two prayers tabled against the SI, though neither were taken into consideration for debate. So only the affirmative aspect got the debate treatment. But we were less than sure what had happened when the Census SI met Parliament in decades past. And as ever, we aim to be compatible with time in all directions. So Jayne went rootling around [Erskine May](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/) and its close Lords' equivalent, the [Companion to Standing Orders](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2017/compso02.htm), in search of anecdotal evidence of what happened to previous Census SIs. Unfortunately, her rootling met with little in the way of success. Erskine has a short page on composite procedures and a very short sentence under negative procedure. "Power has, extremely rarely, been given to both Houses to resolve against part of an instrument subject to annulment, for example the Census Act 1920," we are told. Adding next to nothing to our knowledge. The page on composite procedure does cite a few historical debates. So Jayne dived into Hansard and found three occasions - [1950](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1950-07-11/debates/ae8e2321-7fcb-4d1e-be53-7fb270d71856/DraftCensusOrder), [1960](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1960-05-04/debates/1c7a23e1-70de-4aee-a4e9-026b6c596620/Census) and [1965](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1965-03-18/debates/de4a63b0-8931-4439-9964-7c5d12dfae0e/Census) - when prayers were tabled against the Census SI. In all three cases, rather than have two debates - one for the affirmative half, one for the negative - the Speaker brought them together into one general debate. And in all three cases, the question on the approval motion was put first, with an opportunity to debate the prayer motion following hot on its tail. Though in all three cases, the prayer motions were withdrawn before the question on them was put. This all lead to Jayne and Michael spending Friday morning poking at  pixels in order to allow one general debate on both negative and affirmative motions in both Houses. And indeed separate debates should either happen in isolation. Or not be combined. Time on Monday has been pencilled in to double check and tidy where possible but [early efforts are, as ever, published](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/census.pdf).  If there happens to be anyone reading with experience of past attempts at a composite procedure, do please take a look. Though we can not be held responsible for any resulting retina impairment. And we're still very much on the lookout for anyone with previous experience of clerking a Census SI. An email has been dispatched to David and Paul in case they have any kind of recollection. And if you - or someone you know - dealt with previous Census SIs please do [get in touch](mailto:RIIDMSMailbox@parliament.uk.).

In the meantime, Erskine has pointed Jayne at two [JCSI](https://www.parliament.uk/JCSI) reports, but unfortunately they don't appear to be available online. So she's emailed the [Parliamentary Archives](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/) team in the hope they might be able to get us copies. Though quite how we get our hands on physical copies in these troubled times (â„¢), we're not so sure.


## Your weekly egg timer update

We start this with a confession that [last week's update](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2020/21/) contained a glaring inaccuracy. Michael had misread Librarian Jayshree's email updating us on where she was at with adding sitting and adjournment days to our collection of Google calendars. Because his slightly wonky eyes read January 2019 whilst his brain understood 2020. So, not yet having all the data for last year, it's still impossible to test our work. Apologies to anyone who clicked on [the form](http://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) and got back gobbledegook. This is the price you pay for having a computational expert with a short attention span. Nevertheless, Jayshree continues to add dates to calendars and we hope to be in a position to test - and probably tweak - our calculation logic next week. In the meantime, Robert and Michael continue to make changes, push code and slurp in Jayshree's calendar data. So, if you do click any of the buttons, please be aware that the answer you get now will most probably differ from the answer you get in five minutes. And both answers will probably be wrong. We'll shout Journal Office colleagues when and if we think we've reached the point where proper testing will be useful.

In terms of the actual timing of eggs, Michael has now added a calculator for Commons only [made affirmative Statutory Instruments](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/made-affirmative.pdf). Again we must stress, you can press all the buttons you like but the date returned will not be accurate. If indeed a date is even returned. Michael had intended to add a calculator to cover [Legislative Reform Orders](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/regulatory-reform-committee/regulatory-reform-orders/), [Localism Orders](https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/articles/0jFPWpQS/localism-orders) and [Public Bodies Orders](https://guidetoprocedure.parliament.uk/articles/db4pAIeE/public-bodies-orders), but got confused by the documentation which was less than clear if days during adjournments of less than five days were counted. Or not. An email seeking clarification was dispatched to Journal Office Jane and clarification followed in short order. Unfortunately, the clarification came with the caveat that "Lords virtual sittings don't count so some weekends break the flow", which has left both Librarian Jayne and computational expert Michael quite baffled. More emails are expected. And, just for the sake of completeness, the treaty egg timer work was postponed to next week. For some definition of next. The treaty definition of "day" means no one's really looking forward to taking this one on.

The week saw two egg timer related Skype calls. Or was it Zoom? We forget. Both involved Librarians [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and Jayne and computational experts Robert and Michael. The first was on Wednesday when they met to push pixels around and chat through how the duties accompanying delegated powers described in the [legislation model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/legislation/legislation-ontology.html) might feed into the laying duty described in the [laying model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/laying/laying-ontology.html) and the procedure duty in the [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html). If the egg timer ever proves itself - which is still something of a 50/50 - we'll need some way of identifying a clock start step and a clock end step and a way to tie the two together. We'll also need a way to feed this model with the correct way to count days and the correct number of days to count. It cannot be said that the meeting really solved anything, but they do feel they at least came away with a better understanding of the problem. Which is not nothing. They look to the day when they can just point to a power expressed by [Mr Sheridan](https://twitter.com/johnlsheridan), gobble up accompanying duties as data and shove that all into their egg timer. But that might be some way off.

The second call was spent reading through the [calculation code](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/app/controllers/calculator_controller.rb) and the [monkey patched date model](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/lib/monkey_patching/date.rb) and tweaking comments to make them more legible. Michael is usually terrible at comments but the team hope that at some point they can sit down with JO Jane and show her the comments and it will make at least as much sense as one of her Word documents. We don't think we'll convert Jane from Word to [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) overnight but we hope one day we can get there. If you are reading this Jane, you'll probably have noticed that the two bits of code are linked to above. And we are all too aware of your propensity for clicking things to see what happens. Please feel free to have a gander but be aware that comments are not yet complete so might be harder to follow than would be ideal.

## Always about the collaboration

JO Jane kindly introduced Librarian Jayne to Luke Hussey, the Clerk of the Lords Table Office. As reported [last week](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2020/21/), the revocation of the [Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/edM33LSY/SI-2020345/) and its replacement by the [Abortion (Northern Ireland) (No. 2) Regulations 2020](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/T0WjTwoH/SI-2020503/) had slipped through a procedural crack, with the original instrument being left on the "awaiting debate" shelf. If you've been following along from home, you'll know last week [the team added revocation and replacement steps to both made SI procedures](https://trello.com/c/KWbc8Etq/75-revoked-sis-committee-consideration) and that all instances have now been indexed since the start of the 2017-19 session. Our librarians are now adding new revocations as they happen. Off the back of this work, and to help prevent future crack slippages, they're also now running a daily [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query to check where the revocation step has been used. Every time they flag a new instance, an email makes its way to the Lords Table Office, letting them know which SI has been revoked and whether it had a straight replacement.

Jayne has also extended the offer of our extensive librarian querying skills. Luke is having a think about where else the combination of librarians and SPARQL might be able to help meet information needs. Every day in every way, the data platform as tool for procedural offices makes more and more sense.

## Tiny chisel news

Robert and Michael's tiny chisels took a break from model comments and got stuck into how we should define our [interface model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/interface/interface.html) and what that means for the looseness or tightness of our model coupling. They came up with eight options ranging from no coupling and no interface definitions to the one big model approach that [neither of them like](https://smethur.st/posts/176135865). For now they think they've settled on option 6: keep the individual models decoupled but provide an interface model defining commonly used classes. Then use that as an equivalency hub pointing out to other uses of a class in models elsewhere. There was an open question about whether they'd also define common superclasses centrally and make all inter-model subclass statements point to those. But they came to the conclusion that they'd leave off doing this. For now. At least that's this week's plan.
