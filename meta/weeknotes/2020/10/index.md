# 2020 - Week 10

Librarian Jayne has had another [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQLing week. A solicitor with [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/) contacted Journal Office Peter looking for a filter on the [Statutory Instrument service](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) listing all EU Exit [made affirmatives](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/made-affirmative.pdf) that failed to be approved. Unfortunately, such a filter does not yet exist. Fortunately our [public SPARQL endpoint](https://api.parliament.uk/sparql#) does. The folks at LexisNexis had been doing the work manually, but Jayne [wrangled a query](https://api.parliament.uk/sparql#query=PREFIX+rdfs%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F01%2Frdf-schema%23%3E%0APREFIX+%3A+%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Fid.parliament.uk%2Fschema%2F%3E%0Aselect+distinct+%3FSI+%3FSIname+%3FlayingBodyName+%3FLink+%3FworkPackage+%3Fproc+%3FprocStepName+%3FitemDate+%3FprocStepName2+%3FitemDate1+where+%7B%0A+%3FSI+a+%3AStatutoryInstrumentPaper+.++%0A+++++%3FSI+rdfs%3Alabel+%3FSIname+%3B%0A+++++++++%0A+++++%3AlaidThingHasLaying%2F%3AlayingHasLayingBody%2F%3Aname+%3FlayingBodyName+.%0A++FILTER+regex(%3FSIname%2C+%22EU+Exit%22)%0A++%3FSI+%3AworkPackagedThingHasWorkPackagedThingWebLink+%3FLink+.%0A+++%09%3FSI+%3AworkPackagedThingHasWorkPackage+%3FworkPackage+.%0A++%09%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasProcedure%2Frdfs%3Alabel+%3Fproc%0A+FILTER(%3Fproc+IN+(%22Made+affirmative%22))%0A++%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem%2F%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+%3FprocStep+%3B%0A+++++++++++%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%3FbusItem+.%0A++%3FbusItem+%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep%2Frdfs%3Alabel+%3FitemDate2%3B%0A+++++++++++%3AbusinessItemDate+%3FitemDate+.%0A++%3FprocStep+rdfs%3Alabel+%3FprocStepName.%0A++++%0A++FILTER(%3FprocStepName+IN+(%22Laid+before+the+House+of+Commons%22))%0A++FILTER(%3FitemDate2+IN+(%22Laid+before+the+House+of+Commons%22))%0A++%0A++%0A+++%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem%2F%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+%3FprocStep2+%3B%0A+++++++++++%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%3FbusItem2+.%0A++%3FbusItem2+%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep%2Frdfs%3Alabel+%3FitemDate3%3B%0A+++++++++++%3AbusinessItemDate+%3FitemDate1+.%0A++%3FprocStep2+rdfs%3Alabel+%3FprocStepName2.%0A++%0A++FILTER(%3FprocStepName2+IN+(%22Instrument+stops+being+law%22))%0A++FILTER(%3FitemDate3+IN+(%22Instrument+stops+being+law%22))%0A+++%7D%0A&contentTypeConstruct=text%2Fturtle&contentTypeSelect=application%2Fsparql-results%2Bjson&endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.parliament.uk%2Fsparql&requestMethod=POST&tabTitle=Made+affirmatives+not+approved&headers=%7B%7D&outputFormat=table) making the whole task considerably less onerous. The query returns all made affirmatives with 'EU Exit' in the title that had the 'instrument stops being law' step [actualised](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e382). Applause Jayne.

In more SPARQL news, Jayne had been tinkering around with queries to help with quality checking our data and found that back in October, the [Local Loans (Increase of Limit) Order 2019](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/w7eIPYUN/SI-20191317/) had accidentally been debated without undergoing [EVEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_votes_for_English_laws) certification. She contacted [Daniel](https://www.danielgreenberg.co.uk/house-of-commons/) in the Office of the Speaker's Counsel who confirmed that it would have been 'not certified' anyway. Some blushes being spared here. Jayne has now [put together a query](https://api.parliament.uk/sparql#query=PREFIX+rdfs%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F01%2Frdf-schema%23%3E%0APREFIX+%3A+%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Fid.parliament.uk%2Fschema%2F%3E%0APREFIX+id%3A+%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Fid.parliament.uk%2F%3E%0Aselect+%3FSI+%3FSIname+%3FworkPackage+%3FPNSI+%3Fproc+%3FDLC+%3Fdate+%3FCommonsChamber+%3Fdate1+where+%7B%0A+%3FSI+a+%3AStatutoryInstrumentPaper+.++%0A+++++%3FSI+rdfs%3Alabel+%3FSIname+.%0A+++++%09%3FSI+%3AworkPackagedThingHasWorkPackage+%3FworkPackage+.%0A++%09%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasProcedure%2Frdfs%3Alabel+%3Fproc%0A++FILTER(%3Fproc+IN+(%22Draft+affirmative%22%2C+%22Made+affirmative%22))%0AOPTIONAL+%7B%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%3FDLC.%0A++++%3FDLC+%3AbusinessItemDate+%3Fdate.%0A++++%3FDLC+%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+id%3AFLHAXypO%7D++%0AOPTIONAL+%7B%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%3FCommonsChamber.%0A++++%3FCommonsChamber+%3AbusinessItemDate+%3Fdate1.%0A++++%3FCommonsChamber+%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+id%3AADYK7qyp%7D%0A++MINUS+%7B%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%2F%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+id%3AO5QdnmSL%7D%0A++MINUS+%7B%3FworkPackage+%3AworkPackageHasBusinessItem+%2F%3AbusinessItemHasProcedureStep+id%3ALkpqQD8q%7D%0A%0A%7D%0A&contentTypeConstruct=text%2Fturtle&contentTypeSelect=application%2Fsparql-results%2Bjson&endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.parliament.uk%2Fsparql&requestMethod=POST&tabTitle=SIs+missing+EVEL+scheduled+for+debate&headers=%7B%7D&outputFormat=table) we'll run regularly for Daniel to make sure nothing slips through this same gap in the future. The query returns all SIs that have not been withdrawn and have been considered for EVEL but that have / have not been scheduled for debate.

We think that all this goes to prove - should proof be needed - that the work that's gone into the data platform and the [procedure modelling](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html) has the potential to make a far greater impact than just publishing a website or opening up parliamentary data. It's the first time that procedural people in Parliament have had this information gathered and managed in one place. And certainly the first time it's been queryable. As [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) might say, [if Erskine May had had a computer](https://www.slideshare.net/UKParliData/what-would-erskine-may-do), he may well have built a data platform and a precedence engine out of queries.

That said, the potential extends outside of Parliament's walls. The SPARQL endpoint is public and Jayne continues to add [queries to our GitHub pages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/). So anyone with an interest can take a query, tinker with it and run it. Do [get in touch](mailto:RIIDMSMailbox@parliament.uk) if there's a query you'd like to see and need help writing it.
