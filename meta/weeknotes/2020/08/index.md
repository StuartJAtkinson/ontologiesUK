# 2020 - Week 8

Librarian Jayne has spent a chunk of her week with her trusty [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) spanner in hand, helping a [JCSI](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/statutory-instruments/) / [ESIC](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/european-statutory-instruments/) colleague with some reporting figures. Expect to see more SI related SPARQL on our [queries page](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/) fairly soon.

On the subject of which, [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) got a little distracted writing a Twitter bot with the somewhat crass title of [Tweaty Twacker](https://twitter.com/tweatytwacker). It tweets every time a new treaty is laid into the House of Commons. Or at least every time the laying is added to the data platform. At least in theory. Right now it's waiting on Twitter to assign [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) keys and someone in the Foreign Office to lay a treaty. We're not encouraging anyone to enter into treaties just to test our software but are nonetheless keen to see what happens. Thanks for Jayne for more SPARQLing and [Robert](https://twitter.com/RobertBrook) for figuring out how to [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) the query. Leaving [cURL to Ruby](https://jhawthorn.github.io/curl-to-ruby/) here because it's a dammed handy service should you ever find yourself attempting to turn a cURL into Ruby code.

[Anya](http://twitter.com/bitten_) and Michael lost part of Wednesday morning to stage fright as they reprised their [What would Erskine May do?](https://www.slideshare.net/UKParliData/what-would-erskine-may-do) talk for the House of Commons Library open day. The feedback was good and Michael got to show the assembled librarians his shiny Librarian badge. Thanks [Librarian Liz](https://twitter.com/greensideknits).

Jayne and Michael finally got round to wrapping their fragile minds around Andrew's feedback on their [generic motion model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/motions/motion.pdf). The question of flowcharts vs [state diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) once again raised its head and they're left wondering what they can do - if anything - to change the maps to make this clearer. A new preclusion route was added from question put to motion withdrawn which tightens things up considerably. And Michael has since added a similar route from question put to motion lapsed at end of session. The new lines are drawn in red but the redness is meaningless beyond this is new. Thanks Andrew.

Robert and Michael made the first edit to our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html) in many months. They removed the linkage between [procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e153) and [House](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e237) since all our procedures are bicameral and this predicate was never used in practice. They also added a [Step Grouping](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e282) class which - as the name suggests - groups [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e175) in a procedure in a House. The Step Grouping class has a subclass of [Bill Stage](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e293) which they think is the main usage. But some of the other bubbles on the [public bill procedure flowchart](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/bills/public-bill.pdf) - such as Queen's consent, Prince of Wales' consent and consent motions in the devolved legislatures - probably fit the bill of step groupings rather than bill stages.

Until we discover the next lurking complexity we think we're good for modelling the public bill procedure. Although we think we still need a decision / decideable thing model to cope with couplings that are out of band of the procedure model. And finding a way to reuse bits of procedures in other procedures feels like it would save us time and trouble.

At some point we also need a 'described by' model to link procedures and routes in procedures to the things that inform them. Being Acts of Parliament, Standing Orders, resolutions and etc. Hopefully that will be along soon.

Alerted by [a comment on the schema.org GitHub account](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1743#issuecomment-587406739), Robert and Michael also took a look at [ELI](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/about.html) and how that might map to our models. ELI is an EU project which the [UK has signed up to via The National Archive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/uk.html). It provides a generic model to describe legislative documents and has recently branched out into [draft legislative documents](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/eli-dl/draft1) and some of the - parliamentary - actions associated with changes of state in bill documents.

Most of ELI seems to overlap more with [LDAPP](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/projects/drafting-tool) / [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/) territory than with our procedural models but their the project and activity bits do overlap. At least on a surface level. After some squinting Robert and Michael decided that that the ELI Legislative Project class is similar to our [Work Package](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e259). And the ELI Legal Activity class is similar to our [Business Item](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e248). But unfortunately not all our work packages are 'legislative' and not all our business items are legal activities. So more work is needed here.
