# 2020 - Week 15

Much like any week leading into a bank holiday, it's been a slightly quieter one. Not only do we lose a whole day's productivity to holiday, several days slip by as minds wander to countryside walks, seaside trips and pub gardens. Still, we deserve this break. Oh, God.

Of all of us, [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) has probably had the best week. After coming close to breaking her foot, she's spent the best part of a fortnight being forced to sit in the shower. This not being a time that anyone wants to unduly trouble the NHS, she resorted to Amazon and bought [her own Stormtrooper boot](https://twitter.com/bitten_/status/1247178995826819073). Which, we're told, is working wonders. She's now able to hobble around the house, lending her crack librarian skills to [a taxonomy of her kitchen cupboards](https://twitter.com/bitten_/status/1248190790301605888). We all know Anya and suspect few things could make her happier. A Guinness perhaps. And pubs reopening.

Robert and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) spent several more hours chipping away at the coalface of ontology comments. They have been called slow in the past but they prefer to use the word methodical. Anyway, the [treaty ontology](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/treaty/treaty-ontology.html) comments have now been polished into a diamond like sparkle. They are, as ever, interested in feedback. So in the unlikely event you get 30 minutes free over a packed Easter holiday, please do take a look.

Anya, Librarian Jayne, Robert and Michael took to telephones to finally attempt to parse [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) and Paul's feedback on their [bill amendment model](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/bills/amendments/amendment.pdf). The David bit proved relatively simple and they feel Mr Evans would be secretly pleased to find it took four people two hours to pick apart his subclauses. All of this would have proven much easier if they still had access to their beloved whiteboards. But we all know Anya, Jayne, Robert and Michael. They don't like to whine.

A [tweet on the new treaty comments](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1247528101120053250) occasioned a conversation with a number of Parliament's finest treaty minds on the subject of [the new EU International Agreements Sub-Committee](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-treaties-subcommittee-will-be-vital-in-ensuring-trade-deals-and-international-agreements-are-scrutinised). We like to keep our evenings footloose and fancy free. The conversation continued in email and a plan was hatched on how our [treaty map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf) might be amended. Jayne and Michael again took to telephones and with only minor swearing, created [a new map](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties-play-pen.pdf). Which has now headed off to Journal Office Jane, [Dominique](https://twitter.com/graciado), [Alex](https://twitter.com/AlexanderHorne1) and Ed for sense checking. Jayne and Michael cannot pretend that the Lords' committee allocation is not something of a mess. It's all complicated by [the lack of time-bound routes](https://trello.com/c/CDGB80DD/57-time-bound-routes) which would allow us to say that the routes to the other sub-committees stopped being valid on the day after Easter. Without that we need to add preclusions from the new sub-committee to all the old ones. So that's why the new map looks like blue-rinsed spaghetti.

Some time back, Jayne and Michael removed assorted 'considered by' steps and the [JCSI scrutiny reserve lifted step](https://trello.com/c/4wgUahnQ/69-jcsi-lifted), all of which were considered redundant. This left behind several thousand [business items](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e248) that had been created to [actualise](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e382) these steps. The existence of these business items didn't really impact the service but was a little scruffy. And as librarians, the team abhor scruffiness. Ideally this would be a task best suited to computers, but that wasn't an option we had. So Jayne has spent a large part of the week deleting 4758 business items by hand. Sorry again, Jayne.
