# 2020 - Week 21

## Procedure mapping

Librarian Jayne and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) have had quite a busy week, finally getting around to turning Journal Office Jane's email tennis into maps and data. They kicked off Monday by [adding steps for the depositing of a criminal offences statement](https://trello.com/c/MdQvaYMW/22-deposited-papers-ahead-of-laying-sis-introducing-criminal-offences) by the Government under the key powers in the [EU Withdrawal Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/contents/enacted). Precedence suggests this only happens under affirmative procedures. Primarily drafts but also one made. But neither the Act nor [the statement](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-07-03/HCWS821/) are specific on procedural detail, so this is now added to [all four procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#maps). Because what's the point of a belt of you don't also have braces. By the end of the week, Jayne had gone back and re-indexed all SI work packages from the start of the 2017-19 session. Including, for example, the [Operation of Air Services (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/DSe9UJ2F/SI-2018). And because she is nothing if not cognisant of user needs as emergent from materials, she's also written a [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query returning [all SIs laid into Parliament that have been accompanied by a criminal offences statement](link-to-follow). Because a present is always nicer when wrapped with a bow.

Procedure mapping continued throughout the week as Jayne and Michael donned gardening gloves and finally got stuck into the thorny tangle of [SIs being revoked whilst still before Parliament](https://trello.com/c/KWbc8Etq/75-revoked-sis-committee-consideration). Whilst an SI might be revoked at any point in its life, we are keen to not bite off more than can reasonably be chewed. And tracking the full lifecycle of legislation is really more of a job for our friends at [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/). But where revocation impacts on parliamentary procedure, a keen interest is taken. Drafts being drafts, until they leave Parliament approved or unrejected, they are not by nature on the Statute Book and cannot be revoked. So for the purposes of revocation impacting on procedure, both draft procedures remain untouched. Instruments laid as made, on the other hand, might, in certain odd circumstances, be revoked whilst still subject to parliamentary scrutiny. So both the [made negative](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/made-negative.pdf) and [made affirmative](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/sis/made-affirmative.pdf) procedures now feature new steps and a plethora of new routes to cope with revocation. And indeed replacement. With a strongly worded scope note that these should only be actualised when the revocation takes place during the scrutiny period. Once again, Jayne has gone back to the start of the 2017-19 session and re-indexed all instruments revoked - and occasionally replaced - whilst still before Parliament. Such as the [Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/edM33LSY/SI-2020345/) which was revoked and replaced by the [Abortion (Northern Ireland) (No. 2) Regulations 2020](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/T0WjTwoH/SI-2020503/) whilst approval motions were still before both Houses. And once again, Jayne has take out her SPARQL spanner and written a query to return [all SIs revoked whilst still before Parliament](link-to-follow). Applause Jayne.

New revocation steps brought up the question of whether these should preclude committee decisions. So Jayne and Michael fired up Outlook and fired off another email to JO Jane, who got back in 10 minutes to say in theory, committees should not consider revoked instruments but occasionally one slipped through the net. Such as the [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/JHmYoIfJ/SI-2018852) which was considered by the [JSCSI](https://www.parliament.uk/JCSI). So the decision was taken to add preclusion routes from revocation to committee decisions. Whilst we may be conservative on output, we are always liberal on input. So whenever a committee makes an exception to the general rule, there is nothing to stop us [actualising](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e382) any step - precluded or otherwise. And everyone is happy.

Whilst tackling revocation, Jayne and Michael also added a new step to the made affirmative procedure to handle instruments lapsing. Which usually happens when the government runs out of time to get the approval motions through Parliament. A fate which befell the [Immigration (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/timeline/ztQE1HxF/SI-20191383). Once again, Jayne has re-indexed all SIs since the start of the 2017-19 session to indicate lapsing where pertinent and finely crafted a SPARQL query returning [all lapsed SIs](link-to-follow) for your querying pleasure.

A little while back, the team did [some work on made affirmatives](https://trello.com/c/qjfr3R0z/98-made-affirmatives-under-the-sanctions-act) under the [Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/contents/enacted). They have a slight quirk whereby the egg timer of approval only starts dripping sand when a provision of the regulation comes into force. JO Jane declared herself happy with [the proposed map](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/sis/play-pen/made-affirmative.pdf) but did suggest speaking to someone with a legal brain at the [FCO](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office) before proceeding. And duly put us in touch with just such a person. The FCO have since got back in touch and a rough date of mid-June agreed on to poke and prod maps via pixels and shared screens.

In the course of all these changes, Jayne and Michael noticed they'd added allows routes from [SLSC](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/255/secondary-legislation-scrutiny-committee) decisions to the tabling of an approval motion in the House of Lords. And this in both affirmative procedures. They had no idea when they happened or indeed why. But as any fule kno it quite clearly broke JCSI scrutiny reserve under [Standing Order 72](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/house-of-lords-publications/rules-and-guides-for-business/the-standing-orders-of-the-house-of-lords-relating-to-public-business/#jump-link-12). So those routes [have now been removed](https://trello.com/c/nClMjjLA/114-remove-allows-route-from-slsc-to-lords-motion-to-approve-the-instrument-tabled-by-the-govt).

## Your weekly egg timer update

If you tuned in last week, you'll know that Michael's [egg timer](http://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) date handling code was, for want of a better word, somewhat shonky. This was not a reflection on his handling of sitting days or adjourned days or prorogued days or dissolution days or parliamentary days as yet unannounced. All of which he's fairly confident work just fine. This was his handling of normal days. Like the ones that appear in calendars. To sidestep said shonkiness, he's now stripped out his calendar date class and [monkey patched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) the [Ruby date class](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html). This particular piece of monkey patching appears quite safe since it seems unlikely method names such as `is_commons_short_adjournment?` are part of many people's core date handling. The patching took up a good part of Monday and Tuesday and did not really help to prove the concept. Which was the point of this work. By Wednesday morning he was pretty much back to where he was on Friday night. But happier. And that's not nothing. In these troubled times (TM).

Whilst Michael took apart his code and rewrote it all, Librarian Jayshree was populating our Google calendars with anticipated dates for future sittings. Obviously this anticipation is slightly less reliable than it might normally be. Because the sitting patterns of both Houses are less predictable. In these troubled times (TM).

The Proposed Negative Statutory Instrument calculation had been kicking off its clock on the first joint sitting day as indeed it should have been. But Michael got confused by some paperwork and changed it to the first sitting day of either House. Following chats with the Ja(y)nes, Michael has now changed it back to starting from the first joint sitting day. So again, he's roughly back to where he was last week.

In actual progress news, he's now added a calculator for SIs laid before both Houses to the existing list of PNSIs and Commons only SIs. He's also added a calculator for made affirmatives laid before both Houses. All of which *seems* to work but does require testing. A lot of testing.

Meanwhile, Jayshree has set off backdating our calendars again to the start of the 2017-19 session. Once we have that Jayne will be able to test the calculators against what happened in actuality. And then we'll know whether any of this was worth anything.

Next week, Michael plans to add calculators for Commons only made affirmatives, Legislative Reform Orders, Localism Orders and Public Body Orders. Whilst in no way attempting to put off working on the treaty scrutiny calendar. Which uses a slightly different definition of 'day' and looks a hell of a lot harder.

## Tiny chisel news

Robert and Michael's tiny chisels have been chipping away at model level description comments. Because [this list](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/) looked terrible, read terribly and made them both sad. Some improvement has been detected. Work continues as work always does.

They've also added the [house membership model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/house-membership/house-membership-ontology.html) to the [interface class definitions](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/interface/interface.html) so the [huge ever growing pulsating brain that rules from the centre of the etc](https://api.parliament.uk/webvowl/#opts=sidebar=0;doc=0;mode_compact=true;mode_colorExt=false;#iri=https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/interface/interface.ttl) has grown ever so slightly larger. But you still have to worry about all those subclasses.
