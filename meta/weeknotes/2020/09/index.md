# 2020 - Week 9

The week felt ridiculously busy but looking back there's not an awful lot to type about. If you're here for the procedure modelling you might want to look away now. If you have any interest in querying procedure, Wardley mapping and general purpose process flow modelling, do read on.


Librarian Jayne has continued to wield her [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) spanner, this week in the direction of [committees considering Statutory Instruments](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/committees/). We'd still like to model [reporting criteria](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5801/jtstatin/26/2602.htm), but possibly need more insulation between data platform and website before we venture down that road.

Following a workshop in the morning, [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) found it rather difficult to settle down to actual work. So he grabbed Librarian Jayne and had an impromptu chat about the [occasionally inadvertent power](http://smethur.st/posts/176135865) of [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) [domains](https://www.infowebml.ws/rdf-owl/domain.htm) and [ranges](https://www.infowebml.ws/rdf-owl/range.htm). And how that might be used to design a very simple model to link [procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e153) and [routes in procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e164) to the legislation and [Standing Orders](http://standing-orders.herokuapp.com/) they're described by. More next week, hopefully.

On Wednesday, [Silver](https://twitter.com/silveroliver) and Michael took a trip up east to see [Ganesh](https://twitter.com/gansenthi). Who departed the parliamentary computational section some time back to join [the governmental one](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/). Ganesh's team are using [entity extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to construct sets of [triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) from gov.uk services. They managed to fit in a chat about how the parliamentary procedure model might be applied to describing government services and their applicable entitlement criteria. Michael sketched [part of a flowchart](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1232707694190088194) for the [Jobseeker's Allowance step-by-step](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility) and got rather overexcited that, with a decent process flow model and enough access to domain expertise, [Government as a Platform](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/government-as-a-platform/) might finally be more than [a twinkle in Tim O'Reilly's eye](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/open-government/9781449381936/ch02.html). The whole thing feels dangerously close to the arguments put forward by the [Rules as Code](http://www.slaw.ca/2019/06/14/the-fight-over-rules-as-code/) contigent. Which makes Michael feel a little icky. But still excited. More here, one hopes, shortly.

Thursday saw the return of Silver as he joined Michael in a [Wardley mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) exercise for [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_)'s crack team of librarians. Because they've wrecked a great many whiteboards, they're [no longer allowed to draw on them](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1233378583583870977). So with the help of much paper and some half-dry pens, they scribbled a couple of maps. One for the value chain / dependencies of the [parliamentary search system](https://search-material.parliament.uk/) and one for the slightly more modern data platform. If you squint at the bottom of [this photo](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1233000713359384576), you'll see the stack of pipes, systems and librarians that goes to make the [SI](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) and [treaty trackers](https://treaties.parliament.uk/). Librarian positions and task have now been pulled out of the map and converted into spreadsheets. Michael continues to tinker with the data.
