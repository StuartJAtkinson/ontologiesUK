# 2020 - Week 24

So, this week felt like another of those where lots of things happened but there's really not an awful lot to show. Early efforts at mapping [super affirmative procedure](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/flowcharts/proposed-sis/legislative-reform-order.pdf) proceded no further, but at least we now have a clarifying email from Journal Office Jane. So we hope for better things next week. All the calculations for the egg timer were polished off, but none of them seemed to work. This is life with parliamentary procedure and computers we fear. All we can really do is [keep on keeping on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-l91O9VxN0).

## Procedure mapping

Last week we were all about the enthusiasm for finally mapping the super affirmative procedure(s?). But enthusiasm is no substitute for understanding. So that work took a pause this week and Librarian Jayne and self-titled computational expert [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) decided they'd take a look at the information architecture of [Jayne's SPARQL query pages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/) instead. Information architecture being what pompous computational blokes call filing. And librarians call librarianship. Pages were reorganised, queries re-filed and we think the thing makes somewhat more sense. We now have pages dedicated to [instrument types](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/instrument-types/), be that [Proposed Negative Statutory Instruments](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/instrument-types/proposed-negative-statutory-instruments/), [Statutory Instruments](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/instrument-types/statutory-instruments/) or [treaties](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/instrument-types/treaties/). Though those pages are not yet linked to from the query homepage. A meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon to sort out this oversight but unfortunately Jayne's plumbing exploded. Not wishing to panic anyone here, we should point out that this was the plumbing of the house she lives in. Personal plumbing explosions being a problem that remains firmly in Michael's camp. So next week offers the temptations of more filing and more super affirmative procedure. And if that is not a good reason to get out of bed, we don't know what is.

In other procedural news, we've had a long-standing problem with House of Lords business disappearing over the event horizon. A day having been done, for some reason it disappears off the web never to be seen again. This is a problem for our librarian contigent. If, for any reason, they miss something happening in the Lords, it is missed forever. So [Librarian Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) asked her computational colleagues to deploy their advanced screen scraping skills to [grab a copy of Lords' business at dawn and cache it somewhere before it disappears](https://trello.com/c/0Gzo1tZn/104-make-a-scraper-for-lords-business). Ever willing to please, Robert has taken on this task and is now pointing screen scraping code at the source of the problem.

## All about the collaboration

On Friday Anya and Michael met with Nick from the [Participation Team](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/). Nick works on Committee outreach, organising visits across the UK to bring underrepresented communities together with committee members. To aid him in his work, he's started to build a rudimentary customer relationship management system in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. Nick's spreadsheet captures organisations, their geographic operating areas, the sectors they operate in and the specialisms they cover. He'd heard about the work of IDMS from a colleague and wanted some tips and techniques on how best to catalogue and categorise. Anya promised to send him some of the library indexing principles and Michael committed to taking a look at the spreadsheet in an attempt to make it more relational and better manage "reference data". For want of a better word. Michael also contacted [Gordon](https://twitter.com/gordonkclarke) to check how committee teams handle CRM for evidence givers. In assorted bits of "Word, Excel [and] OneNote" came the not completely reassuring answer.

Way back at the start of May, our friends in Oxford got in touch to say they'd updated their [ParlRules Data](https://parlrulesdata.org/) on [House of Commons public Standing Orders](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/commons/standing-orders-public11/). The new data release has additional text cleaning and is "now organised around whole Standing Orders, rather than the more disaggregated level of sub-articles." Having been distracted by egg timers, Michael finally pulled out his finger and shoved the data through our normal [normalisation script](https://github.com/fantasticlife/standing-orders/blob/master/lib/tasks/setup.rake) and pushed it to our [Standing Order prototype application](http://standing-orders.herokuapp.com/). He's still a little confused about what the move from sub-articles to whole orders means in practice and failed to detect any discernible different in the shape of the data. But we have a call to Oxford pencilled in for Monday. So, hopefully, all will become clear. Or clearer.

## Your weekly egg timer update

If brow wrinkles were [proof of work](https://trello.com/c/4696EfyX/112-prototype-a-calendar), Robert and Michael would be bitcoin billionaires by now. Their foreheads aged by a decent decade as they once more poured over [egg timer](http://parliament-calendar.herokuapp.com/) calculations and, with only minimal swearing, expanded out our monkey patched [date class](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/lib/monkey_patching/date.rb). The [controller](https://github.com/fantasticlife/egg-timer/blob/master/app/controllers/calculator_controller.rb) is now thinner and the model fatter, which is a thing our grey beard friends [tend to applaud](https://www.devinterface.com/en/blog/rails-best-practices-1-fat-model-skinny-controller). And who are we to doubt elders and betters. There is now calculation code for all nine of our supported variations of procedure. So that's progress.

In more good news, the egg timer now returns all the right dates. Just not necessarily for the right instruments. So that's a problem. Next week promises a long, slow trek through the [dank valleys of debugging](https://trello.com/c/78XF5ror/125-test-egg-timer-against-data-we-have). There are quite a lot of moving parts here - from calendar management to calendar synchronisation to the calculations themselves - so we assume Robert and Michael's wee faces will be more wrinkle than flesh by the end of the week.

## Tiny chisel news

Thursday morning saw a pixel based meeting between Anya, Lorna, [Cassie](https://twitter.com/cassier_barton), [Oli](https://twitter.com/olihawkins), Phillip, Robert and Michael to chat though [Economic Indictors](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8808/) and similar library services. It was the first time Anya, Michael and Robert had done any proper domain modelling since lockdown began. It's definitely easier and more of a pleasure with a whiteboard and warm human bodies in the room, but Michael's attempts at Omnigraffle over a shared screen went better than expected. The [picture produced](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/meta/library-information-architecture/economic-indicators/economic-indicators.png) needs to be compared to existing research service models and any gaps firmly plugged. So that's a job for next week perhaps.

Tidying the record model took up a not inconsiderable portion of Anya, Robert and Michael's week. A [new version is now published](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/record/record-ontology.html) but it [still needs work](https://trello.com/c/i2ZKCSuR/126-brarary-website). Particularly around revision management, researcher specialisms and capturing publication cycles. All things that dropped out of the meeting with Lorna et al.
