# 2020 - Week 12

In the interests of some kind of normality, we've decided we'll keep churning out weeknotes. The audience for [semantic web and parliamentary procedure](https://www.slideshare.net/UKParliData/what-would-erskine-may-do) always felt somewhat limited. And we're guessing people have other things on their minds right now. Nevertheless, we intend to keep typing.

We've asked around for memories of what happened on Monday. [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) does recollect a call with [John](https://twitter.com/jb_tweets), a research fellow from [Royal Holloway](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/). John's on an [SSRC funded project](https://www.ssrc.org/fellowships/view/social-media-and-democracy-research-grants/grantees/) looking at if and how Facebook influences Parliament. [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) had provided him with subject indexed Hansard data which he's been using to track trends. Now he'd like more of it and with more structure. Michael put him in touch with [Librarian Liz](https://twitter.com/greensideknits) for taxonomy and indexing guidelines and Sarah from DevOps who's looking to extract more data from more systems. He also introduced him to Emma, a clerk with the petitions committee, and [Cristina](https://twitter.com/estrangeirada) for the public engagement expertise. So that started the week well.

Tuesday saw a couple of very useful meetings. In a room. With actual human people. Which might be something we all look back on with fondness. Anya and Michael took a stroll across the park to Richmond House to meet Daniel, Vanessa and Klara from the Office of the Speaker's Counsel. Librarian Jayne joined by phone. As if practicing for a world with less human contact. The meeting came off the back of a number of questions Jayne had raised about unexpected happenings in the world of [Statutory Instrument procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#flowcharts). There was a suspicion that the team had made a mistake in their procedure mappings and a question about whether they might need to update their maps and data. But it turned out a handful of SIs had dropped through gaps somewhere and expected procedure had not been followed as expected. Jayne is continuing to [write SPARQL queries](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/queries/) to help Speaker's Counsel folks make sure SI trains stay firmly on procedural tracks. The team have long held onto the belief that having [accurate maps of procedure](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#flowcharts) and well managed information would one day yield benefits for procedural and associated offices. And Jayne's queries are a pretty good sign of what the future might offer.

On Tuesday afternoon, Anya and Michael went for one last poke round at our mock-gothic palace. They met Christine, font of knowledge for all things [Church Measure](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/church-of-england-measures/) related. Unfortunately, Jayne couldn't join in person or by phone or in pixels. But fortunately Journal Office Jane popped her head in from the office next door. Which was nice. Back in [week 4](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2020/04/), Jane, Jayne and Michael made a first stab at drawing up how [assorted types of delegated legislation map to parliamentary procedures](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/legislation/delegated-legislation/delegated-legislation.pdf). But no one was too sure how Church Measures fitted. A quick chat with Christine left all convinced that they didn't. And that whilst the may rely on the [Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/9-10/76/contents) for their existence, they are in fact more like primary legislation and not like delegated legislation at all. The upshot of this being Michael has now removed Church Measures from the map. Which felt like a small breakthrough. At least until Jayne pointed out that Michael had misunderstood the actual question and he wasn't supposed to ask about Church Measures but about SI like things that take delegated powers from Church Measures. More emails may follow. Michael apologises to Christine.

The rest of week was a tad more chaotic as librarians and computational experts evacuated from Westminster in search of new working environments at kitchen tables, sofas and occasionally from beds. Michael spent a part of Wednesday making himself a fake calendar to add something resembling structure to his days. It builds in time for emails, phone calls and bird feeding. So far he's not quite stuck to it but that's not so different to usual office life.

There have been more phone calls than usual when it was discovered that, whilst Skype may be here, it is not evenly distributed. Luckily Anya came across a brief guide on [how to set up a conference call on an iPhone](https://support.bell.ca/Mobility/Smartphones_and_mobile_internet/How_to_set_up_a_conference_call_on_an_iPhone). And various other back channels surfaced which seem to have helped keep people connected and sane. 

Anya, Jayne and Michael had a call on Wednesday running through how to use [Lode](https://essepuntato.it/lode/) to transform [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)) ontologies to HTML and the various bits of finicky hacking that accompany that. So our description ontology - which we intend to use to link procedures and [procedure routes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e164) to the the [Standing Orders](http://standing-orders.herokuapp.com/) or items of legislation that describe them - is now available for humans as well as machines.

Jayne and Michael had another call on Thursday to adapt procedure maps and data to take account of feedback from Daniel et al. He'd been concerned about the presence of committee consideration steps in addition to committee decision steps. And Jayne had also expressed unease at the lack of [business items](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e248) to [actualise](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e382) the consideration steps. So committee consideration steps are now stripped out of the [PNSI](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/proposed-negative-sis/proposed-negative-sis.pdf), the SI and the [treaty](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf) procedures and everything is a little neater. Daniel also pointed out that the wording of the committee outcome steps - concerns and no concerns - did not match the style of the committee reports so those have also been updated to reported or not reported. Except for the [SLSC](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/255/secondary-legislation-scrutiny-committee/) which has different wording again.

In other wording news, [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) got back with an answer to the query about the distinction between a motion being negatived and a motion being disagreed to. Apparently, at least in the House of Lords, negatived is used when the motion is not agreed to without being pressed to division. Or 'on the voices' as we say around here. And disagreed to when the motion is not agreed to on division. So that cleared that up. Given the procedure maps the team have drawn out to date distinguish between the outcome of a decision but don't distinguish the mechanism for getting there, a compromise of 'agreed to' and 'not agreed to' was almost arrived at. At which point Mr Evans chipped in to say the original distinction didn't hold in the House of Commons and that were at least three other clauses to take into account. Thinking through such things is made trickier by the suddenness of our separation from whiteboards. So parsing Paul's email might have to wait til more phone calls next week.

So that then was week one of our new lives. Nice at least to see people. If only in pixels. Take good care of each other, everyone.
