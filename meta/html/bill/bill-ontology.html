                </h3>

                <p>The act of carrying a bill over from a session to the following session. A bill being carried over results in the creation of a new bill in the new session, the text of the new bill being the text of the original bill as amended in the previous session. Public Bills which have not been passed by the end of the session in which they were introduced will otherwise fall. A bill being before the House of Commons, it is necessary for that House to pass a carry over motion in order for the bill to be carried over into the following session. Private Members&#39; Bills cannot be carried over.</p>

A draft bill is available to be examined either by a Commons or Lords select committee, or by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament created for that purpose.

                <p>A hybrid bill is a public bill having general application across the whole population, whilst also having been examined and found to differently affect the interests of particular groups, people or places. Hybrid bills are presented as public bills. If examined and found to be hybrid, they follow a procedure including parts of the private bill procedure.</p>

                <p>The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 limit the power of the House of Lords in relation to the House of Commons. The Acts removed the rights of the Lords to pass bills on public tax and spending, to veto or to indefinitely delay the progress of Public Bills. Where a bill is passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords in the same session, the Government may introduce a similar bill in the following session. If the House of Commons invokes the Parliament Act, the House of Lords has one month to agree to the bill, otherwise the Commons may pass the bill unilaterally. The similarity of a bill being introduced in a following session is not made explicit until the Speaker certifies the bill as being subject to the Parliament Act.</p>
