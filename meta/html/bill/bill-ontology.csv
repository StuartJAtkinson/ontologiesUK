Where a bill is passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords in the same session, the Government may introduce a similar bill in the following session. If the House of Commons invokes the Parliament Act, the House of Lords has one month to agree to the bill, otherwise the Commons may pass the bill unilaterally. The similarity of a bill being introduced in a following session is not made explicit until the Speaker certifies the bill as being subject to the Parliament Act."

A bill being carried over results in the creation of a new bill in the new session, the text of the new bill being the text of the original bill as amended in the previous session. Public Bills which have not been passed by the end of the session in which they were introduced will otherwise fall. A bill being before the House of Commons, it is necessary for that House to pass a carry over motion in order for the bill to be carried over into the following session. Private Members' Bills cannot be carried over."
