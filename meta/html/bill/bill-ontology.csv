They replaced the Lords' right to veto Commons Bills with a right only to delay them and put into law the Commons' exclusive powers to pass Bills on public tax and spending. In circumstances where a bill is passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords in the same session, it is possible for the Government to introduce a similar bill in the following session. If the House of Commons chooses to invoke the Parliament Act, the House of Lords has one month to agree to the bill, otherwise the Commons may pass the bill unilaterally. The similarity of a bill being introduced in a following session is not made explicit until the Speaker certifies the bill as being subject to the Parliament Act."
