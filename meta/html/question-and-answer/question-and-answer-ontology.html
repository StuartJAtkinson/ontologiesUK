                </h3>

                <p>A time-bound means of defining the form of answer expected for a question, being oral or written. In the House of Commons, a question tabled in expectation of an oral answer may change to a question in expectation of a written answer - and would have two Answer Expected As relationships: one for the first period when the form of answer expected is oral and one for the second period when the form of answer expected is written.</p>

                </h3>

                <p>In the House of Commons, the change from an expectation of an oral answer to an expectation of a written answer. The change of expectation may be because the Member tabling the question is unable to attend the Chamber at the time the question was due to be answered, or because a question may be due in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. In the case of a Member not being present, they may either withdraw or unstar the question. Unstarring removes the question from the Order Paper and changes the form of the answer expected to written. When a question is not reached, the question is given a written answer unless the Member withdraws the question. In the House of Lords, a different Member attends the Chamber and asks the question on the tabling Member&#39;s behalf when the tabling Member cannot attend. There is no requirement for unstarring. In the House of Lords, questions tabled in expectation of an oral answer are always reached. There is no requirement for handling questions not reached.</p>

                <p>A body of whom Members can ask questions. In the House of Commons this may be a government department, a Parliamentary body or a body external to Parliament, for example: the House of Commons Commission or Church Commissioners. In the House of Lords, questions are addressed to Her Majesty&#39;s Government rather than to a department or body. In the House of Lords, the Table Office assigns written and private notice questions to an answering body. For questions in expectation of an oral answer, no assignment takes place.</p>

                <p>Parliamentary questions - often referred to as PQs - are a means by which Members may seek information from an answering body, or ask a Secretary of State to take a particular action. They are usually asked of a Minister in a Government department, though questions can be asked of Members representing non-departmental bodies, for example: Church Commissioners. Parliamentary questions can be asked in expectation of either a written or an oral answer, spoken by a Member in the Chamber. Parliamentary questions are tabled in the Table Office of the Lords or the Commons.</p>

                <p>Urgent questions are a means by which Members of the House of Commons may ask a Minister a question which the Member considers requires an immediate answer. In the House of Lords such questions are referred to as private notice questions. Urgent questions and private notice questions are applied for to the Speaker or the Lord Speaker rather than being tabled in the Table Office: the text of an urgent question or a private notice question does not appear on the Order Paper. A debate in the Chamber takes place if an application is granted.</p>

                <p>Relates a question to an allocation to an answering body. In theory, allocation allows a single question to be assigned to multiple answering bodies. This would be a major change from existing practice where the same question, when asked of different answering bodies, is considered to be a set of different questions. A question intended for multiple answering bodies is sometimes referred to as a round robin question. Because round robins are loosely defined and because the question text might vary slightly - for example, when referring to the gender of the answering member - treating a round robin as a single question is not yet possible.</p>

                <p>Allows an answer to be associated with one or more questions. This replicates more precisely the current functionality around grouped questions. In other words, a group of questions tabled by a single Member in receipt of the same answer. There is some debate as to whether the same text given in answer to questions from multiple Members can be considered one, or the same, answer. This also allows a single question to have many answers. Sometimes there will be multiple answers from a single answering body at different points in time (holding answer, substantive answer, corrected substantive answer). Sometimes different answers from different answering bodies to the same question e.g. answers to a round robin question. Note that this is a major change to current data models, where a single question can have one and only one answer, and a single answer can be to one and only one question.</p>

                <p>Indicates if a question is substantive. If true the question text will be meaningful and constitute the actual question that the Member wished to ask. If false the question text will be boilerplate text asking about a government department or the Prime Minister&#39;s appointments (respectively topical questions and Prime Minister&#39;s questions in the House of Commons). This will be answered in the Chamber, after which the asking Member will ask a supplementary question. This is a device to enable Members to ask supplementary questions on any topical subject without notice. It only applies to parliamentary questions expecting an oral answer and only applies in the House of Commons. The process for topical questions in the House of Lords differs slightly from that in the House of Commons, in that all questions tabled are substantive. Here topical refers to the shorter notice period allowed when tabling a question.</p>
