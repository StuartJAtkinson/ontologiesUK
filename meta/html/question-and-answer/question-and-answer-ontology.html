                </h3>

                <p>A time-bound means of defining the form of answer (oral or written) expected for a question. Sometimes a question in pursuit of an oral answer will be scheduled to be asked in the Chamber, but the Member intending to ask the question will be unable to attend the Chamber at that time. At this point the Member may either withdraw the question or &#39;unstar&#39; it. Unstarring has the effect of removing the question from the schedule and requesting a written answer. Sometimes a question may be scheduled in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. Unless the Member subsequently indicates that they wish to withdraw the question, a written answer will be given. In either scenario, such questions would have two Answer Expected As relationships: one for the initial period when the form of answer expected is oral and one for the second period when the form of answer expected is written. Note that the rules regarding unstarred and unreached questions only apply in the House of Commons. In oral question time in the House of Lords, a Member may ask a question on behalf of another Member.</p>

                <p>Parliamentary questions - often referred to as PQs - are a means by which Members may seek information from an answering body, or ask a Secretary of State to take a particular action. They are usually asked of a Minister in a Government department, though questions can be asked of Members representing non-departmental bodies, for example: Church Commissioners. Parliamentary questions can be asked in expectation of either a written or an oral answer, spoken by a Member in the Chamber. Parliamentary questions are tabled in the Table Office of the Lords or the Commons.</p>

                <p>Urgent questions are a means by which Members of the House of Commons may ask a Minister a question which the Member considers requires an immediate answer. In the House of Lords such questions are referred to as private notice questions. Urgent questions and private notice questions are applied for to the Speaker or the Lord Speaker rather than being tabled in the Table Office: the text of an urgent question or a private notice question does not appear on the Order Paper. A debate in the Chamber takes place if an application is granted.</p>

                <p>Relates a question to an allocation to an answering body. In theory, allocation allows a single question to be assigned to multiple answering bodies. This would be a major change from existing practice where the same question, when asked of different answering bodies, is considered to be a set of different questions. A question intended for multiple answering bodies is sometimes referred to as a round robin question. Because round robins are loosely defined and because the question text might vary slightly - for example, when referring to the gender of the answering member - treating a round robin as a single question is not yet possible.</p>

                <p>Allows an answer to be associated with one or more questions. This replicates more precisely the current functionality around grouped questions. In other words, a group of questions tabled by a single Member in receipt of the same answer. There is some debate as to whether the same text given in answer to questions from multiple Members can be considered one, or the same, answer. This also allows a single question to have many answers. Sometimes there will be multiple answers from a single answering body at different points in time (holding answer, substantive answer, corrected substantive answer). Sometimes different answers from different answering bodies to the same question e.g. answers to a round robin question. Note that this is a major change to current data models, where a single question can have one and only one answer, and a single answer can be to one and only one question.</p>

                <p>Indicates if a question is substantive. If true the question text will be meaningful and constitute the actual question that the Member wished to ask. If false the question text will be boilerplate text asking about a government department or the Prime Minister&#39;s appointments (respectively topical questions and Prime Minister&#39;s questions in the House of Commons). This will be answered in the Chamber, after which the asking Member will ask a supplementary question. This is a device to enable Members to ask supplementary questions on any topical subject without notice. It only applies to parliamentary questions expecting an oral answer and only applies in the House of Commons. The process for topical questions in the House of Lords differs slightly from that in the House of Commons, in that all questions tabled are substantive. Here topical refers to the shorter notice period allowed when tabling a question.</p>
