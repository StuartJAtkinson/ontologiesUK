The change of expectation may be because the Member tabling the question is unable to attend the Chamber at the time the question was due to be answered, or because a question may be due in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. In the case of a Member not being present, they may either withdraw or unstar the question. Unstarring removes the question from the Order Paper and changes the form of the answer expected to written. When a question is not reached, the question is given a written answer unless the Member withdraws the question. In the House of Lords, a different Member attends the Chamber and asks the question on the tabling Member's behalf when the tabling Member cannot attend. There is no requirement for unstarring.
