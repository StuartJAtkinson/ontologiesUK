The change of expectation may be because the Member tabling the question is unable to attend the Chamber at the time the question was due to be answered, or because a question may be due in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. In the case of a Member not being present, they may either withdraw or unstar the question. Unstarring removes the question from the Order Paper and changes the form of the answer expected to written. When a question is not reached, the question is given a written answer unless the Member withdraws the question. In the House of Lords, a different Member attends the Chamber and asks the question on the tabling Member's behalf when the tabling Member cannot attend. There is no requirement for unstarring.

"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/question-and-answer/answerTo","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","Allows an answer to be associated with one or more questions. This replicates more precisely the current functionality around grouped questions. In other words, a group of questions tabled by a single Member in receipt of the same answer. There is some debate as to whether the same text given in answer to questions from multiple Members can be considered one, or the same, answer. This also allows a single question to have many answers. Sometimes there will be multiple answers from a single answering body at different points in time (holding answer, substantive answer, corrected substantive answer). Sometimes different answers from different answering bodies to the same question e.g. answers to a round robin question. Note that this is a major change to current data models, where a single question can have one and only one answer, and a single answer can be to one and only one question."
