The first session of a parliament begins on the same day as the parliament period: this date is given in the dissolution proclamation at the end of the previous parliament. The session ends on the day set in a subsequent prorogation proclamation. Subsequent sessions within the parliament period begin and end on dates set in subsequent prorogation proclamations. The last session of a parliament ends with prorogation followed by dissolution. Session periods are the same for both Houses.</p>

                <p>Any item of business which has been tabled e.g. a motion, parliamentary question, amendment or committee membership nomination. Note not all things that can be tabled must be tabled e.g. manuscript amendments are amendments which are raised on the day the business occurs. In other words, no notice has been given. For this reason they do not appear on the day&#39;s business papers and are rarely selected for debate. Manuscript amendments do not appear on the marshalled list.</p>

                <p>The act of tabling a business item into either the House of Commons or House of Lords. Tabling is the act of formally putting forward a question, a motion, an amendment or a committee membership nomination. Members do this by submitting it to procedural clerks. The item will then appear in the next day&#39;s business papers as a written notice. Each House has a Table Office where parliamentary questions, motions for debate and, in the Commons, early day motions are tabled. Amendments to bills are always tabled in the Public Bill Offices of each House.</p>
