Tabling is the act of formally putting forward a question, a motion, an amendment or a committee membership nomination. Members do this by submitting it to procedural clerks. The item will then appear in the next day's business papers as a written notice. Each House has a Table Office where parliamentary questions, motions for debate and, in the Commons, early day motions are tabled. Amendments to bills are always tabled in the Public Bill Offices of each House."
