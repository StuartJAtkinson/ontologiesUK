<h3>Act of Parliament

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>An Act of Parliament creates, amends or repeals legislation. An Act is a Bill having been passed by Parliament and been given Royal Assent. Acts of Parliament which are in force comprise statute law also known as the statute book.</p>

<article class="class">
<h3>Draft and made statutory instrument subject to parliamentary procedure

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>The National Archives classify made instruments as legislation and draft instruments as draft legislation. Parliament considers both made and draft instruments as part of the legislative process, distinct from a FRBR work as used by The National Archives. Parliament includes draft instruments in its description of statutory instruments which are modelled here together.</p>

<article class="class">
<h3>Draft statutory instrument

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>Draft statutory instruments are laid before Parliament, and may be objected to. A draft instrument is made into secondary legislation when signed by a government minister. Draft statutory instruments are published by The National Archives and classified by them as a FRBR work.</p>

<article class="class">
<h3>Made statutory instrument

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>Made statutory instruments may progress from draft, or be laid without draft before Parliament as made. Parliament may consider particular instruments as made with imposing a duty to lay. For example: commencement orders. Made statutory instruments may be objected to within Parliament. A made instrument has been signed into secondary legislation by a government minister. Made statutory instruments are published by The National Archives and classified by them as a FRBR work.</p>




</article>

<article class="class">
<h3>Power

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>A power delegated by one or more items of primary legislation, enabling the exercise of regulations as described in the Act.</p>

<article class="class">
<h3>Proposed negative statutory instrument

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>A regulation - made under a power or powers set out in clauses 7, 8 or 9 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 - which government ministers propose be laid under the negative procedure. Sifting committees of either House may recommend that any subsequent statutory instrument or instruments be laid under the affirmative procedure.</p>

<article class="class">
<h3>Statutory instrument series

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>A statutory instrument may appear in one or more series, or in none. Series include: Welsh Instruments, corresponding to Wales Statutory Instruments; Northern Ireland Orders in Council; Commencement Orders; Appointed Day Orders; Legal Statutory Instruments; and Scottish Statutory Instruments, being United Kingdom instruments that have particular application to Scotland.</p>




</article>

<article class="class">
<h3>Statutory instrument series item

<span class="subhead">class</span></h3>
<!-- http://parliament.uk/ontologies/legislation/ -->

<p>A statutory instrument series item links a draft or made statutory instrument subject to parliamentary procedure to a statutory instrument series. A statutory instrument can be included by means of an item in more than one series excepting these cases: Northern Ireland series instruments do not form part of any other series; legal series instruments do not form part of any other series; National Assembly for Wales series SIs and Scottish series instruments can be included in the commencement order series but no other. Commencement order series items may also form part of either the Welsh or Scottish series. Where an instrument appears as an item in more than one series, the citation order is formed by (1) the commencement order series and item identifier followed by (2) any other series and item identifier. Where the instrument is made by the Welsh Ministers, the &#39;W. / Cy.&#39; number follows the SI number.</p>
