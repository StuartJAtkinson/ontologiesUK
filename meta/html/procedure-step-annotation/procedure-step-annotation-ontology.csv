"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/procedure-step-annotation/Step","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","A step is either a business step, a logic gate step or a decision step. Steps are joined by routes to form procedures. For example, within the SI procedures there exists a step named 'English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) consideration'. Steps may occur in more than one procedure. For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step."
