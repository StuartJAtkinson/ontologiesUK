Eventually, the type of the thing focussed on may be derived from any ‘focus’ relationships, together with the types of the things being focussed on. Presently, the things that focus categories point at have insufficient definition to support a determination of their type, for example: the Scottish Grand Committee would have a library subject heading or concept of Scotland as a focus category, typed as a geographic entity rather than as a devolved nation. Aggregating a list of formal bodies with a focus on devolved nations would not be possible from the 'focus' relationships alone: the focus category gives a higher level means to group formal bodies by interest areas. A focus category is able to be populated regardless of whether the thing focussed on is sufficiently defined, for example: 'focus' may point to a named item of legislation, with the focus category recording that the formal body was constituted to scrutinise a specific item of legislation but without identifying which."
