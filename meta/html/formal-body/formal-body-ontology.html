                <p>A focus category provides a way to aggregate formal bodies by the type of thing they focus on or scrutinise, for example: a type of legislation, one or more government departments, matters specific to devolved nations. Eventually, the type of the thing focussed on may be derived from any ‘focus’ relationships, together with the types of the things being focussed on. Presently, the things that focus categories point at have insufficient definition to support a determination of their type, for example: the Scottish Grand Committee would have a library subject heading or concept of Scotland as a focus category, typed as a geographic entity rather than as a devolved nation. Aggregating a list of formal bodies with a focus on devolved nations would not be possible from the &#39;focus&#39; relationships alone: the focus category gives a higher level means to group formal bodies by interest areas. A focus category is able to be populated regardless of whether the thing focussed on is sufficiently defined, for example: &#39;focus&#39; may point to a named item of legislation, with the focus category recording that the formal body was constituted to scrutinise a specific item of legislation but without identifying which.</p>

                <p>A group formally constituted by Parliament to conduct specific business within Parliament, for example: a committee or a group acting as a committee. Formal groups are subject to parliamentary procedure and operate under parliamentary privilege. A formal body may be established by means of procedure - for example: by Standing Order - or by another process, for example: selection of the Advisory Panel on Works of Art by the Lords’ Speaker. A formal body may be established under statute, for example: the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, by means of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Justice and Security Act 2013. People in a formal body are Members of the House of Commons or of the House of Lords. A formal body may be joint, taking membership from both Houses. Groups with informally constituted memberships are not formal groups, for example: All-Party Parliamentary Groups. Informally constituted groups are not subject to parliamentary procedure and do not operate under parliamentary privilege.</p>

                <p>There are Select Committees in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Select Committees conduct inquiries into and report on matters as directed by their remit. The results of inquiries are public. The government may be expected to respond to a published inquiry. Select Committees in the House of Commons are primarily concerned with examining the work of government departments. Select Committees in the House of Lords concentrate on broader themes rather than on individual government departments. When a Select Committee in the House of Lords is not deliberating, any peer may attend and speak at the committee. When a Select Committee in the House of Lords is deliberating, peers without membership of the committee may not attend, unless invited by the Committee to do so. Any peer not being a member of a Select Committee in the House of Lords cannot vote in that committee.</p>
