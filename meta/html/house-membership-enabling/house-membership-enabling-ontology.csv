A person may have more than one incumbency over time. Only one person can be incumbent in a house seat at one time. A person having a seat incumbency which has a start date in the past and an end date in the future - or which has no end date - is a current Member. A person having a seat incumbency with an end date in the past - and no current incumbency - is an ex-Member."
