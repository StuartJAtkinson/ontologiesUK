The number of spoiled ballots may be included in a calculation of turnout. Turnout as calculated by the House of Commons Library - and generally in academic usage - is the total number of votes cast and not spoiled, divided by the size of the electorate. Turnout as calculated by Returning Officers is the total number of votes cast, divided by the size of the electorate."

"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/election/ParliamentPeriod","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","The time period of a single Parliament between the date of its first assembly after a general election and its dissolution. A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods. During a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force, the date of dissolution was determined by that Act or was named in a proclamation following a vote in Parliament for an early general election. The next Parliament began on the date named in the proclamation issued following a dissolution. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 came into force and after that Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the date of dissolution is fixed by proclamation. The dissolution proclamation also names the date for Parliament to reassemble. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801."
