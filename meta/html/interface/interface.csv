A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods: during a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. Until 2015, the dissolution proclamation named the date for Parliament to reassemble. After 2015, a Parliament begins on the date named in the proclamation issued after a dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. Until 2015 the date of dissolution was indeterminate and fixed by proclamation. After 2015 the date of dissolution is determined by the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011, or is named in a proclamation after Parliament has voted for an early general election. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801."

"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/interface/Procedure","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification."
