                <p>The time period of a single Parliament between the date of its first assembly after a general election and its dissolution. A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods: during a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. Until 2015, the dissolution proclamation named the date for Parliament to reassemble. After 2015, a Parliament begins on the date named in the proclamation issued after a dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. Until 2015 the date of dissolution was indeterminate and fixed by proclamation. After 2015 the date of dissolution is determined by the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011, or is named in a proclamation after Parliament has voted for an early general election. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801.</p>

                <p>There is a defined period of time during which Members of either House can object to negative and made affirmative statutory instruments. Only certain calendar days are included when calculating this period. The total number and nature of days on which a Member can object are defined by statute and differ across parliamentary procedure. These statutory days comprise consecutive days including weekends, excluding any days during which Parliament is dissolved, or prorogued, or any period during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days. Differences in sitting days between Houses are not taken into account, unless the instrument is laid into the House of Commons only. In this case the calculation is based on Commons sitting days and short adjournments. On the day on which a negative statutory instrument is laid, a forty day time period commences during which it is possible for Members to &#39;pray&#39; against (table a motion objecting to) the instrument. This forty day period is defined by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. For made affirmative statutory instruments the time limit is set out in the enabling Act, rather than in the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. It is typically 28 or 40 days. The time period commences on the day the instrument is made, rather than laid. The enabling Act stipulates which days are counted towards the time limit, and typically follows the logic previously described.</p>
