                <p>The period during which Parliament is dissolved. During this time no parliamentary business can take place. From the time of dissolution until the returning of a result for a constituency in a general election, that constituency has no Member sitting in the House of Commons. Winners returned for a constituency in a general election are Members from the time of being returned, even if Parliament is dissolved. Members of the House of Lords retain their memberships during a dissolution period. A dissolution period applies to both Houses. A proclamation to dissolve Parliament is made under a prerogative power of the Crown.</p>

Hybrid sitting days are determined by each House separately. Parliament considers that a hybrid sitting day may continue beyond midnight to include more than one calendar day: such a hybrid sitting day is called by the date of the calendar day on which it begins.</p>

                <p>The time period of a Parliament between the date of its first assembly after a general election and the dissolution of that Parliament. We use the term Parliament period in this ontology to distinguish between a Parliament being a named period of time and Parliament as an institution. A Parliament period comprises contiguous periods while Parliament is either in session or prorogued. A Parliament period applies to both Houses. Proclamations naming dates for the assembly and dissolution of Parliaments are issued by the monarch. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament reassembled. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a Parliament begins on the date named in a proclamation issued following dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament dissolved. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of dissolution is determined according to that Act.</p>

Except in the case of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, Sch. 7 para. 17(11), which uses the above definition, legislation assumes one calendar day to be one sitting day.</p>
