"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/time-period/ParliamentarySittingDayType","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","COMBINED COMMENT FROM OLD CLASSES: A sitting day in a House is a day during which that House considers business, with Members being quorate in the Chamber of that House and in the presence of the Mace. The Mace signifies the Monarch as a component part of Parliament. Sitting days are determined by each House separately. Parliament considers that a sitting day may continue beyond midnight to include more than one calendar day: such a sitting day is called by the date of the calendar day on which it begins. Except in the case of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, Sch. 7 para. 17(11), which uses the above definition, legislation assumes one calendar day to be one sitting day. ///// A hybrid sitting day in a House is a day during which that House considers business, with a quorum of Members, including both those present in the Chamber and those attending remotely, and in the presence of the Mace. Hybrid sitting days are determined by each House separately. Parliament considers that a hybrid sitting day may continue beyond midnight to include more than one calendar day: such a hybrid sitting day is called by the date of the calendar day on which it begins. //// A virtual sitting day in a House is a day during which that House considers business with a quorum of Members attending remotely, without the presence of the Mace. During a virtual sitting day, a House can conduct a debate but cannot put a question for decision. Questions are put to the House when not sitting virtually."

A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods. During a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force, the date of dissolution was determined by that Act or was named in a proclamation following a vote in Parliament for an early general election. The next Parliament began on the date named in the proclamation issued following a dissolution. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 came into force and after that Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the date of dissolution is fixed by proclamation. The dissolution proclamation also names the date for Parliament to reassemble. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801."
