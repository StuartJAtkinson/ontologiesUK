We use the term Parliament period in this ontology to distinguish between a Parliament being a named period of time and Parliament as an institution. A Parliament period comprises contiguous periods while Parliament is either in session or prorogued. A Parliament period applies to both Houses. Proclamations naming dates for the assembly and dissolution of Parliaments are issued by the monarch. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament reassembled. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a Parliament begins on the date named in a proclamation issued following dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament dissolved. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of dissolution is determined according to that Act."

We use the term Parliament period in this ontology to distinguish between a Parliament being a named period of time and Parliament as an institution. A Parliament period comprises contiguous periods while Parliament is either in session or prorogued. A Parliament period applies to both Houses. Proclamations naming dates for the assembly and dissolution of Parliaments are issued by the monarch. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament reassembled. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a Parliament begins on the date named in a proclamation issued following dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament dissolved. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of dissolution is determined according to that Act."
