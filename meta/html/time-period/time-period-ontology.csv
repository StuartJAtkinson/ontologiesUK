We use the term Parliament period in this ontology to distinguish between a Parliament being a named period of time and Parliament as an institution. A Parliament period comprises contiguous periods while Parliament is either in session or prorogued. A Parliament period applies to both Houses. Proclamations naming dates for the assembly and dissolution of Parliaments are issued by the monarch. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament reassembled. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a Parliament begins on the date named in a proclamation issued following dissolution. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. Before the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a dissolution proclamation named the date on which Parliament dissolved. After the passing of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of dissolution is determined according to that Act."

The session ends on the day set in a subsequent prorogation proclamation. Subsequent sessions within the parliament period begin and end on dates set in subsequent prorogation proclamations. The final session of a parliament ends either with prorogation followed by dissolution or with dissolution. Session periods are the same for both Houses."

"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/time-period/StatutoryDay","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","There is a defined period of time during which Members of either House can object to negative and made affirmative statutory instruments. Only certain calendar days are included when calculating this period. The total number and nature of days on which a Member can object are defined by statute and differ across parliamentary procedure. These statutory days comprise consecutive days including weekends, excluding any days during which Parliament is dissolved, or prorogued, or any period during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days. Differences in sitting days between Houses are not taken into account, unless the instrument is laid into the House of Commons only. In this case the calculation is based on Commons sitting days and short adjournments. On the day on which a negative statutory instrument is laid, a forty day time period commences during which it is possible for Members to 'pray' against (table a motion objecting to) the instrument. This forty day period is defined by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. For made affirmative statutory instruments the time limit is set out in the enabling Act, rather than in the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. It is typically 28 or 40 days. The time period commences on the day the instrument is made, rather than laid. The enabling Act stipulates which days are counted towards the time limit, and typically follows the logic previously described."
