A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods. During a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force, the date of dissolution was determined by that Act or was named in a proclamation following a vote in Parliament for an early general election. The next Parliament began on the date named in the proclamation issued following a dissolution. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 came into force and after that Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the date of dissolution is fixed by proclamation. The dissolution proclamation also names the date for Parliament to reassemble. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801."

During this time no parliamentary business can take place. From the time of dissolution until the returning of a result for a constituency in a general election, that constituency has no Member sitting in the House of Commons. Winners returned for a constituency in a general election are Members from the time of being returned, even if Parliament is dissolved. Members of the House of Lords retain their memberships during a dissolution period. A dissolution period applies to both Houses. A proclamation to dissolve Parliament is made under a prerogative power of the Crown."
