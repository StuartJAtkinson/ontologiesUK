                <p>Relates a Letters Patent to its ordinality on the date of presentation. This is used as a proxy for precedence. A peerage of a higher rank will have a lower ordinality - and greater precedence - than a peerage of a lower rank whose Letters Patent are presented on the same day. For peerages of the same rank presented on the same day, precedence is determined by the time of day at which the Letters Patent was presented. A peerage whose Letters Patent is presented earlier in the day is determined to have a greater precedence - and lower ordinality - than a peerage of the same rank whose Letters Patent is presented later in that day.</p>
