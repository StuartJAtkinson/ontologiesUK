Kingdom is used in this model to denote what is usually known as the peerage of a kingdom, for example: the Kingdom of Scotland denotes the Peerage of the Kingdom of Scotland. We avoid using the word peerage because this is already used to describe a single title, for example: the peerage of the Earldom of Plymouth.</p>
