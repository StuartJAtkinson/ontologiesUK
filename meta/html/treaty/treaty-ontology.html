Parliament considers both made and draft instruments as part of the legislative process, distinct from a FRBR work as used by TNA. Parliament includes draft instruments in its description of statutory instruments, which are modelled here together.</p>

All treaties are laid before Parliament following ratification, though this is not a requirement set out in the 2010 Act and does not trigger a parliamentary procedure.</p>

                <p>A treaty is published in a treaty series as a treaty series item. At any time, a treaty series item is always in a treaty series. A treaty may be placed in a new treaty series by means of a new treaty series item. Treaty series are defined by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Country Series lists bilateral agreements which are not yet in force. The European Union Series lists multilateral agreements between member states of the European Union, or between third parties and member states of the European Union, which are not yet in force for the UK. The Miscellaneous Series lists multilateral agreements where the UK is a signatory and which are not yet in force. A treaty subject to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 is listed in one of the Country, European Union or Miscellaneous series when first laid before Parliament. If Parliament does not object to ratification of the treaty, the treaty becomes available to the government to ratify and then may come into force. Once a treaty has entered into force it is published in the FCO Treaty Series. The Treaty Series lists agreements that have completed all necessary procedures and are now in force for the UK.</p>
