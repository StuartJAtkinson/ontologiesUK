There are occasions on which two business items actualising two different steps happen in the same work package on the same day: this class determines the display depth of those two business items. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it is not possible to order business items in a way that makes 'procedural sense', for example: we may show 'procedure concluded' before an instrument has been approved. Step display depth exists in order to allow a number to be associated with a step in a procedure allowing us to order by the date of the business item, then by the display depth of the step in the procedure. Display depth in this context is not absolute across the procedure. A step with depth 8 may happen before a step with depth 7. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening."

"http://parliament.uk/ontologies/procedure/RouteAvailability","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment","The availability of a route over time. A route may be open or closed. A route may reopen after being closed. The availability of a route may change as a result of a change to legislation, for example: routes in the procedure for proposed negative statutory instruments laid under Section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will only remain open- as set out under the Act - until two years after completion day. The availability of a route may change as a result of a standing order being introduced, suspended or rescinded, for example: the standing orders setting out rules for English Votes for English Laws were first suspended, then rescinded. The availability of a route may change as a result of an order of a House in Parliament, for example: a formal proceeding may establish a new committee, creating a new route to a step for consideration by that committee."
