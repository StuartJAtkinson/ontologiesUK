A step collection is always within one procedure. A step collection may group one or more steps. Step collections are used to collect steps of one type, for example: starting steps, concluding steps, key steps, bill stage steps, or Member action steps. A step collection named 'Starting steps' collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be started. A procedure may have one or more starting steps. A step collection named 'Concluding steps' collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be concluded. A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named 'Second reading', within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House. A step collection named 'Key steps' collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be key to that procedure. A procedure may have one or more steps described as key steps. A step collection named 'Member action steps' collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be steps at which a Member is able to take an action. A procedure may have one or more steps considered to be Member action steps."
