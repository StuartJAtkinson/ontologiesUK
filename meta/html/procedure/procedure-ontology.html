        <section id="description">A general purpose process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work in Parliament resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</section>

A citation may be from a procedure, for example: the proposed negative statutory instrument procedure citing Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. A citation may be from a step in a procedure, for example: the step &#39;CF - AND&#39; in the made negative statutory instrument procedure citing Section 4(1) of the Statutory Instrument Act 1946. A citation may be from a step without reference to a particular procedure, for example: the step &#39;Considered for English votes for English laws (EVEL) certification&#39; citing House of Commons public Standing Order 83P. A citation may be from a route in a procedure, for example: the route from &#39;Considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments&#39; to &#39;Motion to approve the instrument tabled by the Government (House of Lords)&#39; in both affirmative procedures citing House of Lords public Standing Order 72.</p>

                <p>A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification.</p>

                <p>A route is a link from one step to another. The source of a route may also be its destination. A route is available when the from step is True, actualised by a business item having a date in the past, or by the input from a logic gate step being True. The validity period of a route may be indicated by its start or end date. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised indicates that actualisation of the step will happen in the future, being a causal relationship.</p>

                <p>A step is either a business step, a logic gate step or a decision step. Steps are joined by routes to form procedures. For example, within the SI procedures there exists a step named &#39;English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) consideration&#39;. Steps may occur in more than one procedure. For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step.</p>

                <p>A collection of steps. Step collections are used to collect steps of one type, for example: starting steps, concluding steps, key steps, bill stage steps, or Member action steps. A step collection named &#39;Starting steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be started. A procedure may have one or more starting steps. A step collection named &#39;Concluding steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be concluded. A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named &#39;Second reading&#39;, within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House. A step collection named &#39;Key steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be key to that procedure. A procedure may have one or more steps described as key steps. A step collection named &#39;Member action steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be steps at which a Member is able to take an action. A procedure may have one or more steps considered to be Member action steps.</p>

                <p>The display depth of a business step in a procedure. There are occasions on which two business items actualising two different steps happen in the same work package on the same day: this class determines the display depth of those two business items. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it is not possible to order business items in a way that makes ‘procedural sense’, for example: we may show &#39;procedure concluded&#39; before an instrument has been approved. Step display depth exists in order to allow a number to be associated with a step in a procedure allowing us to order by the date of the business item, then by the display depth of the step in the procedure. Display depth in this context is not absolute across the procedure. A step with depth 8 may happen before a step with depth 7. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening.</p>

                <p>Relates a business item to a step in a procedure by means of a route. For example, relating the second reading of a public bill to the second reading step in the procedure. A step may be actualised by more than one business item in different work packages. A business item may actualise one or more steps. For example, a business item appearing in the Order Paper including a debate on several motions may actualise steps relating to each motion.</p>
