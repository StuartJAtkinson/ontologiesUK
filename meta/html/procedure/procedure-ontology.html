        <h1>Procedure ontology</h1>

        
        <article>A general purpose process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work in Parliament resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</article>

                <p>A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification.</p>

                <p>A route is a link from one step to another. The source of a route may also be its destination. A route is available when the from step is True, actualised by a business item having a date in the past, or by the input from a logic gate step being True. The validity period of a route may be indicated by its start or end date. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised indicates that actualisation of the step will happen in the future, being a causal relationship.</p>

                <p>A step is either a business step, a logic gate step or a decision step. Steps are joined by routes to form procedures. For example, within the SI procedures there exists a step named &#39;English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) consideration&#39;. Steps may occur in more than one procedure. For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step.</p>

                <p>A collection of steps in a procedure. A step collection may belong to one House, or none. A step collection is always within one procedure. A step collection may group one or more steps. Step collections are used to collect steps of one type, for example: starting steps, concluding steps, key steps, bill stage steps, or Member action steps. A step collection named &#39;Starting steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be started. A procedure may have one or more starting steps. A step collection named &#39;Concluding steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be concluded. A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named &#39;Second reading&#39;, within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House. A step collection named &#39;Key steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be key to that procedure. A procedure may have one or more steps described as key steps. A step collection named &#39;Member action steps&#39; collects steps in a procedure which are considered to be steps at which a Member is able to take an action. A procedure may have one or more steps considered to be Member action steps.</p>

                <p>A step has one type: a business step type, a decision step type, a logical NOT step type, a logical AND step type or a logical OR step type. Business step: a step that can be actualised by a business item. Decision step: a step that is used to describe the requirement for a decision to be made before the subsequent route can be followed. Routes including a decision step indicate that the target step is allowed and not caused: a route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised by means of a decision step indicates that actualisation of the step may happen in the future, being an allowed relationship. Logical step: a step that describes logical operations performed over routes. Inputs and outputs of a logic gate are either TRUE or FALSE. The output from a business step which has been actualised by a business item with a date in the past is TRUE. The output from a business step which has not been actualised, or which has been actualised with a business item with a date in the future, is neither TRUE nor FALSE: this is recorded as NULL. A NULL route entering a logic step acts as a bypass to that step: a logic gate with a NULL input outputs the other given input, or NULL if there is no other input.</p>
