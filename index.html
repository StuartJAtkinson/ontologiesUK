			<h2>Models</h2>
			<h3>Interface</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="interface/interface.html">Interface classes</a></h4>
					<p>An ontology describing interfaces between models used by UK Parliament, by means of equivalent classes.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Work in progress</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="agency/agency-ontology.html">Agency ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing people and groups of people with agency. The model also describes a person’s membership of and positions in groups.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="business-item/business-item-ontology.html">Business item ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing items of business taking place in Parliament or outside Parliament - as part of a process involving Parliament - and their scheduling.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="contact-point/contact-point-ontology.html">Contact point ontology</a></h4>
					<p>Model to handle the contact details of things. Postal addresses, phone numbers, emails etc.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="contribution/contribution-ontology.html">Contribution ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model to handle contributions to things by agents.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="core/core-ontology.html">Core ontology</a></h4>
					<p>Provides a set of common properties available for use by other models. Includes modelling for basic web links and alternative identifier schemes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="description/description-ontology.html">Description ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing the connection between a thing having a description and the thing providing that description, for example: a procedure as described by an item of legislation, or a procedure route as described by a Standing Order.
</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="document/document-ontology.html">Document ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A basic model for documents and collections of documents.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="election/election-ontology.html">Election ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing incumbencies resulting from general elections and by-elections for seats in the House of Commons, by-elections for excepted hereditary peers in the House of Lords and elections for positions including that of the Speaker of the House of Commons. The model describes the result of an election process, rather than the process by which an election has been conducted: election returns by the “first past the post” system and those which follow other methods are included. Where applicable, the model is aligned with the Cabinet Office Election Result Data Standard.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="formal-body/formal-body-ontology.html">Formal body ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing formally constituted bodies, including committees.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="formal-body-affiliation/formal-body-affiliation-ontology.html">Formal body affiliation ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing specialisations of group affiliations and positions specific to formal bodies, for example: ex-officio membership of a committee, or chairing of a committee.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="government-organisation/government-organisation-ontology.html">Government organisation ontology</a></h4>
					<p>Adds some specialised classes to the agency model to capture specific types of incumbencies, positions and groups.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="house-membership/house-membership-ontology.html">House membership ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing a person occupying a seat in a House, by means of an incumbency over a period of time.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="procedure/procedure-ontology.html">Procedure ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A general purpose process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work in Parliament resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="procedure-step-annotation/procedure-step-annotation-ontology.html">Procedure step annotation ontology</a></h4>
					<p>A model describing annotations added to procedure steps by the Indexing and Data Management Section of the House of Commons Library. Annotations are used to describe how a procedure step is actualised.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="concept/concept-ontology.html">Concept ontology</a></h4>
					<p>Concept ontology for UK Parliament. Deprecated in favour of SKOS.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4><a href="stats-series/stats-series-ontology.html">Stats series ontology</a></h4>
