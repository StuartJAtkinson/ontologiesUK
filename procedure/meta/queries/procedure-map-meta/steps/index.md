## Query to generate a CSV of procedure step descriptions

We used to maintain a separate spreadsheet of [procedure steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e175) with scope notes, link notes and information around how to select a date for a [business item](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#d4e248). This spreadsheet was stored in a Sharepoint Library - separate from the procedure data - and only available to users on the parliamentary network. We wanted to put our Information Management approach alongside the data where any user can access it.
