## Query of time-bound routes in procedure maps

Procedures are subject to change. Change may happen as a result of changes to statute, changes to standing orders, resolutions of the House, a speaker ruling or new interpretations of precedent. 

When procedure does not change there might still be changes as the mechanics of government change. For example, new committees might be established to reflect changes in government. To reflect this we add start and end dates to routes. Examples might be:

* a route to committee x would have an end date when that committee ceases to exist.

* a route to EVEL certification would have a start date to capture when the EVEL procedure came into being.

* a route to EVEL would have an end date if the EVEL legislation is ever repealed. 

Without time bound routes it becomes impossible to reflect changes to procedure over time and mpossible to predict the "future possibility space" of an instrument subject to a procedure. Because all possible routes would remain possible regardless of whether they had been 'repealed'.

The following query shows all of the routes that are time-bound with either a start date, an end date or both:
