# Making available bodies

As per our [making available model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/making-available/making-available-ontology), a making available body is a body empowered to make materials available to a House: being a Government department, a Government organisation, a non-governmental organisation with a duty to answer questions, an organisation with a duty to lay papers or a committee.

A list of the bodies that exists in our current data can be found below. Due to machinery of government changes, some bodies may have been closed, for example the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy which closed in February 2023 and was replace by Department for Business and Trade and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.
