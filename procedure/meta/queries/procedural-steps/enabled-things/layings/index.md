# Enabled things by laying body

Enabled things will be laid before Parliament by a laying body, or in the case of published drafts under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 Parliament a notification will be laid. The duty of a body to lay papers before a House is imposed by an Act of Parliament.
