# Queries for a timeline on the [Statutory Instrument Service website](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/)

A trace was performed on 4 March 2022 on the published draft [Financial Services Act 2021 (Prudential Regulation of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms) (Consequential Amendments and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2022](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/instrument/yxrXHdd7/timeline/wkQfLNnh/) in order to receive all sparql queries that inform the timeline. 

We're publishing the queries here as part of the work on [adding logic to our procedural maps](https://trello.com/b/nBCRWUdD/procedure-logic-gates). Specifically, whether we can [remove route types](https://trello.com/c/5WVH6SW9/277-check-removing-route-types-doesnt-break-website) from our data without impacting the website.
