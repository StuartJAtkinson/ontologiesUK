# Business about a (prospective) treaty before it’s signed or before it’s laid before Parliament

In November 2022 we made the decision to add business steps about a treaty that occurred before a treaty is signed or laid before Parliament.

The government has precedent for engaging with Parliament via ministerial statements during the negotiation stage of a treaty or at the point a treaty has been signed but the treaty has not been laid before Parliament under the [Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2). Committees can also open inquiries and take evidence on a treaty before it’s laid as well.

The following queries detail all pre-laying business on treaties since June 2017.

## Ministerial statements

Ministers can make many different statements to the House before a treaty is laid. The primary purpose is to keep the House informed about how negotiations are proceeding. Statements are also a useful way of keeping interested committees up to date and to give them an indication on what scrutiny may be required.

## Government's trade negotiation objectives

The Government can choose to publish a comprehensive set of documents setting out the UK's strategic approach to free trade agreements with other partieis. Usually, in line with the government's commitment to scrutiny and transparency, they will deposit these documents in both House libraries as well as on gov.uk.

The government may then follow up with a response to such a report. The following query shows all scrutiny reports and where the government has responded.

## Informational copies of treaties laid before Parliament

Informational copies of treaties made be laid in both Houses at the point the treaty is signed. The purpose of this is to allow parliamentary scrutiny to begin, particularly for the benefit of committee inquiries and evidence sessions. As the copies are informational it means that [CRaG](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2) is not yet invoked so the objection period has not yet started.

## Trade and Agriculture Commission advice to the Secretary of State for International Trade

The Trade and Agriculture Commission's purpose is to provide advice under section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020 (see below). In preparing a report relating to free trade agreements under that section, the Secretary of State must request advice from the Commission and lay before Parliament any such advice received in response to said requests. Generally, the advice should be published before any report but there has been one instance where the report was laid first. The Trade and Agriculture Commission's role is outlined under [Part 3 of the Trade Act 2021](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/10/part/3/enacted).

## Publication of a report pursuant to Section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020 on a free trade agreement laid before the House of Commons/House of Lords

Under [section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/21/section/42), a free trade agreement that includes measures applicable to trade in agricultural products may not be laid before Parliament under [Part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2) unless the Secretary of State has first laid a report  before Parliament. The report must explain whether, or to what extent, the measures are consistent with the maintenance of UK levels of statutory protection in relation to — (a) human, animal or plant life or health, (b) animal welfare, and (c) the environment.
