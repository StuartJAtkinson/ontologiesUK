# Published drafts under Paragraph 14 of Schedule 8 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018

After the UK left the European Union, a two-stage affirmative procedure applied to any instruments that amended or revoked secondary legislation originally made under the European Communities Act 1972 (most Directives were implemented that way). First the statutory instrument must be published in draft for 28 days to allow for comment. Second, when the instrument is formally laid, the Minister must make a "scrutiny statement" which sets out the Government response to any recommendations made by a parliamentary committee on the draft, and any other representations on the instrument (this will normally be published in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the following statutory instrument). The following instrument laid need not be identical to the published draft. 

For more details on published drafts see paragraphs 13 to 15 of Schedule 8 to the [European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/8/enacted). The [procedure map for published drafts](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/published-drafts-under-euwa/published-drafts-under-euwa.pdf) is also available to view.
