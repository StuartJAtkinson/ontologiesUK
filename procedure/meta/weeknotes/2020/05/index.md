\cf2 \cb3 Three HoC only instruments were considered by the JCSI when according to our models they should have been considered by the SCSI. JCSI lawyers have suggested it was within the JCSI remit to do so. Awaiting JCSI Clerk to come back with more information as this would impact the routes around HoC only SIs and committee steps.\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 When a made negative instrument has been revoked during its objection period the JCSI will not consider it but instead will move on to the \'91new\'92 SI. Two occasions we\'92ve seen that happen since we started the SI Service. But it has raised questions for Jane as the SLSC does consider it. If the SI is revoked does it conclude? Does the clock stop? Do we need to model for this?\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 This is wrapped up in time bound routes as committees can change (Department for Exiting the European Union for example is likely to end). Claire can still provide a list of committees for the session to the card as a checklist but we won\'92t be able to update the models until the time bounded issue is developed.\cb1 \

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \ul \ulc4 Tabling of approval motion before laying}}\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 This came about as a result of the first Exit Day SI potentially needing to be approved on the day it was laid (it didn\'92t in the end), which would require a business motion to table an approval motion. The tabling of the business motion and the approval motion would need to take place before the SI was laid. Our routes currently don\'92t accommodate that possibility. We got lucky at the time as the SI was laid as a made negative so no approval motion was necessary, but as it is possible we should probably model for it.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Following on from the last meeting where we talked about the requests to model other procedure, Michael and I met with Jane White to discuss. This has brought a whole new beast about other types of delegated legislation in general that use variations on the procedure models \'96 example being the Immigration Rules is laid under the draft negative procedure. It also brought to the fore the super made affirmative procedure. Michael and I are planning to sit down tomorrow to go through all the information Jane provided (it was a lot) to see what we need to do next model wise.\cb1 \
\cb3 Caveat: This is not for the purpose of adding different delegated leg types to the website. We\'92re treating this work completely separately from SI Service/Treaty Tracker land. This is primarily because we have no development time for the work this would entail.\cb1 \
