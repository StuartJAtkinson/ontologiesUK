# 2020 - Week 05

## Awaiting clerkly confirmation (new items)
â€¨### [Commons only items considered by JCSI] (https://trello.com/c/Ho11p2xf/74-commons-only-instruments-considered-by-jcsi) 
Three HoC only instruments were considered by the JCSI when according to our models they should have been considered by the SCSI. JCSI lawyers have suggested it was within the JCSI remit to do so. Awaiting JCSI Clerk to come back with more information as this would impact the routes around HoC only SIs and committee steps.
Â 
### Revoked Instruments not considered by JCSI
When a made negative instrument has been revoked during its objection period the JCSI will not consider it but instead will move on to the â€˜newâ€™ SI. Two occasions weâ€™ve seen that happen since we started the SI Service. But it has raised questions for Jane as the SLSC does consider it. If the SI is revoked does it conclude? Does the clock stop? Do we need to model for this?
Â 
### Northern Ireland Statutory Rules
I would explain this one but I need to go back over my own notes and precedent to understand what the JCSI Clerk saidâ€¦.
Â 
Â 
Blocked â€“ awaiting development (new items)
Â 
Treaties: Explicit Commons and other Joint Select Committees
This is wrapped up in time bound routes as committees can change (Department for Exiting the European Union for example is likely to end). Claire can still provide a list of committees for the session to the card as a checklist but we wonâ€™t be able to update the models until the time bounded issue is developed.
Â 
Doing (new items)
Â 
Tabling of approval motion before laying
This came about as a result of the first Exit Day SI potentially needing to be approved on the day it was laid (it didnâ€™t in the end), which would require a business motion to table an approval motion. The tabling of the business motion and the approval motion would need to take place before the SI was laid. Our routes currently donâ€™t accommodate that possibility. We got lucky at the time as the SI was laid as a made negative so no approval motion was necessary, but as it is possible we should probably model for it.
Â 
Other types of delegated legislation
Following on from the last meeting where we talked about the requests to model other procedure, Michael and I met with Jane White to discuss. This has brought a whole new beast about other types of delegated legislation in general that use variations on the procedure models â€“ example being the Immigration Rules is laid under the draft negative procedure. It also brought to the fore the super made affirmative procedure. Michael and I are planning to sit down tomorrow to go through all the information Jane provided (it was a lot) to see what we need to do next model wise.
Caveat: This is not for the purpose of adding different delegated leg types to the website. Weâ€™re treating this work completely separately from SI Service/Treaty Tracker land. This is primarily because we have no development time for the work this would entail.
Â 
Step descriptions
Jayne is working on descriptions of all steps, similar to the work that Anya/Robert did on procedure descriptions (that you can read on the website: Made negative, Draft negative, Made affirmative, Draft affirmative). Slow going between getting Clerkâ€™s time to look at it or Clerkâ€™s agreementâ€¦.but itâ€™s started.
Â 
Done (new items)
Â 
EU Select Sub-Committee preclusions
All preclusion routes have been added to the EU Select Sub-committees. Flowchart (Looks like a spider has danced across the Lords) and Procedure editor updated.
Â 
Instrument approved steps â€“ Scope notes updated
Scope notes updated to clarify when we use these steps.
Â 
Should motion not moved hang in space?
Resolved by the motion model (though weâ€™re still awaiting clerky feedback here)
Â 
SPARQL training
Just a reminder that weâ€™re trying to organise Sparql training. This will be particularly useful for those of us using the SI Service/Treaty Tracker so Iâ€™d encourage you to say yes when the invite comes ðŸ˜Š. Iâ€™m going to be sending out the SI Service QA document sometime next week (ironing out some issues) which is heavily based on SPARQL queries. Likewise, the procedural step spreadsheet is going to be shelved and replaced by a SPARQL (coming to you hopefully tomorrow!). We did some work adding and updating everything from the spreadsheet into procedure editor and therefore the data platform â€“ this means everything is searchable and more reliable than the spreadsheet!
