 
Allocation of Time motions might cover:
 
Committal of the bill (which will almost invariably be to Committee of the whole House, but does not have to be)
Prevention of consideration of an Instruction to the Committee (which could in principle be tabled by someone other than a Minister, in order to widen the scope of what could be considered in committee, and debated if selected by the Speaker)

Omit questions for a) reporting the Bill, b) considering the Bill and c) considering Lords Amendments (and instead simply proceed to those stages without needing the Houseâ€™s express agreement at the time)

Provide for what questions are put on conclusion of proceedings on a particular stage of the bill, for the order in which they are put, and for some questions to be omitted (e.g. the question is put only that a new clause be added to the Bill, and not first that it be read a second time) or to be rolled up into a single question (e.g. the question is not put separately on successive Government amendments to the same clause; a single question only is put)

Appointment of a Reasons Committee



Disapplication of SO No. 82 (Business Committee, which in practice is never operated these days anyway)
Enabling Ministers (and only Ministers) to alter the order of consideration, recommit the bill, move a motion varying or supplementing the provisions of the order after it has been agreed, or move dilatory motions
Provision for the timing of emergency debates or private business set down for consideration on the day when the bill is to be considered



Enabling questions to be put on financial questions (money and ways and means resolutions) relating to the bill.
