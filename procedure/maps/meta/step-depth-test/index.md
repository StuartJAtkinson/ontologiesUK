# Step depth testing

Please follow this document to test the changes made to the QA and live environments of the Statutory Instrument Service and Treaty Tracker for [step depth work](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#business-items-actualisation-and-step-depths).

If you need access to the QA environments of both websites then please contact Software Engineering or DevOps for login details and instructions.

The following workpackages have all been selected as they have calendar days where many business items have been added. In the current live version the business items are not ordered in the correct procedural order. To establish whether the timeline queries have been updated correctly we should be checking each workpackage to see if the ordering is now as expected.
