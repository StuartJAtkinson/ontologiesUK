# Logic for CRaG treaty motions and statements

[Logical map](redux.pdf)

## Assumptions

In period A, one House resolving against ratification does not stop the other House from acting.

In any given period, in any given House, more than one motion against ratification can be tabled. Ony allowing one motion per period per House would simplify matters, but MH implies Members could table "reasoned" motions.

## A question may be put

In a given period, in a given House, a question is ALLOWED be put if ...

... the SUM of motions being withdrawn, having lapsed, being not moved and being not called ...

... does NOT EQUAL the number of motions tabled.

At the end of any period, all extant motions will be placed into one of the four states above.

A motion being approved in a period in a House, the Table Offices will request that Members withdraw any motion still extant.

A motion being approved in a period in a House, any extant motions being not withdrawn will be placed into a state of 'not called'.
