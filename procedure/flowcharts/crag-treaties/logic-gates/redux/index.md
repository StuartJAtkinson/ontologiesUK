# Logic for CRaG treaty motions and statements

[Logical map](redux.pdf)

## Assumptions

In any given period, in any given House, more than one motion against ratification may be tabled. Purely from a mapping and parsing perspective, one motion per period per House would simplify matters. MH suggests Members may wish to table "reasoned" motions so this logic allows for multiple motions in parallel,

## A question may be put

In a given period, in a given House, a question is ALLOWED be put if ...

	... the SUM of motions having the question put, being withdrawn, lapsed, not moved and not called ...

	... does NOT EQUAL the number of motions tabled.

At the end of any period, all extant motions - those not having had the question put - will be placed into one four states: being withdrawn, lapsed, not moved and not called.

A motion being approved in a period in a House, the Table Offices will request that Members withdraw any motion still extant.

Regardless of whether the motion is withdrawn, the Table Offices will remove any extant motion from the Order Paper.

A motion being approved in a period in a House, any extant motions being not withdrawn will be placed into a state of 'not called'. This may vary across Houses and is still to be decided upon.
